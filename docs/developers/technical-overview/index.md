How the Sonic hub coordinates spoke networks: asset movement, unified tokens, deterministic wallets, intent settlement, and cross-network messaging.

### Infra goals

* Any EVM dapp can reach any user on any connected network without changes
* Any EVM dapp can reach any token on any connected network without changes
* Any token can be bridged to any other connected network
* Cross-network messaging stays simple and reliable with little overhead

### App goals

* A money market that can delegate liquidity across products and services
* A hub that unifies liquidity and execution for connected networks

> **Error handling conventions:** This module uses the canonical `SodaxError<BridgeErrorCode>` shape (same family as the swap and money market modules). Discriminate on `result.error.code` (e.g. `'RELAY_TIMEOUT'`, `'INTENT_CREATION_FAILED'`); structured details live on `result.error.context` (`srcChainKey`, `dstChainKey`, `phase`, `relayCode`, `field`). See the **Error Handling** section below for the full per-method code table and migration notes from the legacy `error.message`-based pattern.

The `BridgeService` class, reachable via `sodax.bridge`, orchestrates cross-chain token transfers within the SODAX hub-and-spoke architecture.

Bridging works by depositing tokens into a spoke vault on the source chain, which triggers a cross-chain message relayed to the Sonic hub. The hub then performs vault transformations (deposit/withdraw) and forwards the tokens to the destination chain via the asset manager.

Three transfer directions are supported:
- **Spoke → Hub** — deposit into hub vault
- **Hub → Spoke** — withdrawal from hub vault
- **Spoke → Spoke** — deposit on source + withdraw on destination

> **Backend Bridge API.** For the typed HTTP client over the backend `/bridge/*` routes (`sodax.api.bridge`
> — allowance/approve/create-intent, submit-tx + status, tokens), see [`BRIDGE_API.md`](https://github.com/icon-project/sodax-sdks/blob/main/packages/sdk/docs/BRIDGE_API.md). The
> `bridge()` orchestrator routes the spoke-deposit through that API by default (`bridge.useBackendSubmitTx`,
> default ON) with a client-side fallback; set `new Sodax({ bridge: { useBackendSubmitTx: false } })` to
> force the client-side relay — see
> [`CONFIGURE_SDK.md`](https://github.com/icon-project/sodax-sdks/blob/main/packages/sdk/docs/CONFIGURE_SDK.md#backend-submit-tx-bridgeusebackendsubmittx).

## Methods

### isAllowanceValid

Checks whether the caller has sufficient token allowance to execute the bridge.

The required spender varies by chain type:
- **Hub (Sonic)**: the caller's hub wallet router contract
- **EVM spoke**: the spoke chain's asset manager contract
- **Stellar**: validated by the Stellar spoke service (no explicit spender needed)
- **All other chain types** (e.g. Solana, NEAR, Bitcoin): returns `true` — approvals are not applicable

**Parameters:**
- `_params`: `BridgeParams<S, Raw>` — bridge parameters including source chain key, token, amount, and sender address

**Returns:** `Promise<Result<boolean>>`

**Note**: For Stellar-based operations, the allowance system works differently:
- **Source chain (Stellar)**: this method checks and establishes trustlines automatically via the Stellar spoke service.
- **Destination chain (Stellar)**: clients must manually check trustlines using `StellarSpokeService.hasSufficientTrustline` before executing bridge operations.

**Example:**
```typescript
import { ChainKeys } from '@sodax/sdk';

const result = await sodax.bridge.isAllowanceValid({
  params: {
    srcChainKey: ChainKeys.BASE_MAINNET,
    srcAddress: '0xYourAddress...',
    srcToken: '0x1234567890abcdef...',
    amount: 1000000000000000000n, // 1 token in base units
    dstChainKey: ChainKeys.POLYGON_MAINNET,
    dstToken: '0xabcdef1234567890...',
    recipient: '0x9876543210fedcba...',
  },
  walletProvider: evmWalletProvider,
});

if (result.ok && result.value) {
  console.log('Allowance is sufficient');
} else {
  console.log('Need to approve tokens first');
}
```

### approve

Grants token spending approval required before executing a bridge.

**Some tokens take two transactions.** A few ERC-20s of the 2017 TetherToken lineage — Ethereum USDT
is the only one in the SODAX token list today — reject an allowance change from one non-zero value to
another, so `approve` sends `approve(0)` first and waits for it to be mined before the real approval.
The user signs twice; the returned value is still a single transaction hash, the **last** one's.
Detection simulates the approval rather than consulting a token list, so a token listed later behaves
the same way.

Approval targets differ by chain:
- **Hub (Sonic)**: approves the caller's hub wallet router contract.
- **EVM spoke**: approves the spoke chain's asset manager contract.
- **Stellar**: delegates to the Stellar spoke service for trustline/allowance handling.
- **All other chain types**: returns an error — approvals are not supported.

When `raw` is `true`, the encoded transaction is returned without broadcasting.
When `raw` is `false`, the transaction is signed and submitted via the provided wallet provider.

**Parameters:**
- `_params`: `BridgeParams<K, Raw>` — bridge parameters including source chain key, token, amount, wallet provider, and `raw` flag

**Returns:** `Promise<Result<TxReturnType<K, Raw>>>`

**Note**: For Stellar-based operations, the approval system works differently:
- **Source chain (Stellar)**: this method establishes trustlines automatically.
- **Destination chain (Stellar)**: clients must manually establish trustlines using `StellarSpokeService.requestTrustline` before executing bridge operations.

**Example (signed):**
```typescript
import { ChainKeys } from '@sodax/sdk';

const result = await sodax.bridge.approve({
  params: {
    srcChainKey: ChainKeys.BASE_MAINNET,
    srcAddress: '0xYourAddress...',
    srcToken: '0x1234567890abcdef...',
    amount: 1000000000000000000n,
    dstChainKey: ChainKeys.POLYGON_MAINNET,
    dstToken: '0xabcdef1234567890...',
    recipient: '0x9876543210fedcba...',
  },
  walletProvider: evmWalletProvider,
});

if (result.ok) {
  console.log('Approval transaction hash:', result.value);
} else {
  console.error('Approval failed:', result.error.message);
}
```

**Example (raw):**
```typescript
const result = await sodax.bridge.approve({
  params: { /* ... */ },
  raw: true,
  // walletProvider must NOT be passed when raw: true
});
```

### Stellar Trustline Requirements

For Stellar-based bridge operations, trustlines must be handled depending on whether Stellar is the source or destination chain. See the [Stellar Trustline Requirements](https://github.com/icon-project/sodax-sdks/blob/main/packages/sdk/docs/STELLAR_TRUSTLINE.md#bridge) doc for detailed information and code examples.

### bridge

Executes a full end-to-end bridge transfer: spoke deposit → relay → hub settlement.

Internally calls `createBridgeIntent()` to submit the spoke-side deposit transaction, then completes the transfer via one of two paths (see [Completion paths and `timeout`](#completion-paths-and-timeout) below). Use this method for the typical "fire and wait" bridge UX.

This method is signed-execution only (`raw: false`). For raw transaction building, use `createBridgeIntent()` directly.

**Parameters:**
- `_params`: `BridgeParams<K, false>` — bridge parameters including source/destination chain keys, token addresses, amount, recipient, wallet provider, and optional `timeout` (a **per-attempt** budget — see below)

**Returns:** `Promise<Result<TxHashPair>>` — `{ srcChainTxHash, dstChainTxHash }` on success, where `srcChainTxHash` is the spoke deposit tx and `dstChainTxHash` is the hub settlement tx.

**Example:**
```typescript
import { ChainKeys } from '@sodax/sdk';

const result = await sodax.bridge.bridge({
  params: {
    srcChainKey: ChainKeys.BASE_MAINNET,
    srcAddress: '0xYourAddress...',
    srcToken: '0x1234567890abcdef...',
    amount: 1000000000000000000n,
    dstChainKey: ChainKeys.POLYGON_MAINNET,
    dstToken: '0xabcdef1234567890...',
    recipient: '0x9876543210fedcba...',
  },
  walletProvider: evmWalletProvider,
  timeout: 30_000, // optional, per attempt; defaults to DEFAULT_RELAY_TX_TIMEOUT
});

if (result.ok) {
  const { srcChainTxHash, dstChainTxHash } = result.value;
  console.log('Bridge successful:', { srcChainTxHash, dstChainTxHash });
} else {
  console.error('Bridge failed:', result.error.message);
}
```

#### Completion paths and `timeout`

`bridge()` completes through the **backend submit-tx path by default** (`bridge.useBackendSubmitTx`, default `true`): it hands the broadcast deposit to the bridge API (`sodax.api.bridge.submitTx`), which relays server-side, and polls submit-tx status. On **any** non-success — submission rejected, terminal `failed`/abandoned, or the poll running out — it falls back to the client-side `relayTxAndWaitPacket` flow so the bridge still completes, returning the same `TxHashPair` either way. That is safe because re-relaying an already-relayed deposit is idempotent, and it matters in practice: the backend keeps processing at its own pace after the SDK gives up, so the two relays can race. Set `new Sodax({ bridge: { useBackendSubmitTx: false } })` to force the client-side path.

On-chain verification (`verifyTxHash`) runs on the **client-side path only** — the backend runs its own, so verifying before handing the deposit over would delay every backend success by the source chain's confirmation wait and could fail a bridge the backend would have completed. `TX_VERIFICATION_FAILED` therefore never surfaces on a bridge the backend completes.

`timeout` is a **per-attempt** budget, not an end-to-end deadline. Each phase is bounded by a different thing:

| Phase | Bound |
| --- | --- |
| `createBridgeIntent` — build, sign, broadcast | **not** bounded by `timeout` |
| Backend attempt — submit POST + status poll | `timeout` |
| ↳ any single backend request within it | `min(budget left in the attempt, api.timeout)` |
| On-chain verification — client-side path only | the source chain's `pollingConfig.maxTimeoutMs` |
| Relay wait — client-side path only, starts after verification | `max(timeout, RELAY_FALLBACK_FLOOR_MS)` |

So a stalled backend cannot shorten the fallback's relay wait, and raising `timeout` grows both attempts. Worst-case wall-clock is `createBridgeIntent + timeout + verification + max(timeout, RELAY_FALLBACK_FLOOR_MS)` — reached only when the backend accepts the submission and then never finishes. Bridge has no solver post-execution, so unlike swaps there is no `'posting_execution'` step and no post-execution term.

Read the constants from source rather than memorising them: `DEFAULT_RELAY_TX_TIMEOUT`, `DEFAULT_BACKEND_API_TIMEOUT` and per-chain `pollingConfig` live in [`@sodax/types`](https://github.com/icon-project/sodax-sdks/tree/main/packages/types/src), and `RELAY_FALLBACK_FLOOR_MS` in [`IntentRelayApiService.ts`](https://github.com/icon-project/sodax-sdks/blob/main/packages/sdk/src/shared/services/intentRelay/IntentRelayApiService.ts). Verification timeouts differ widely by chain, so derive them per chain from `chains.ts`. The swaps side documents the identical model in more depth — see [How `timeout` bounds each attempt](https://github.com/icon-project/sodax-sdks/blob/main/packages/sdk/docs/SWAPS.md#how-timeout-bounds-each-attempt) — and [BRIDGE_API.md](https://github.com/icon-project/sodax-sdks/blob/main/packages/sdk/docs/BRIDGE_API.md) covers the API client itself.

### createBridgeIntent

Submits the spoke-side deposit transaction that initiates a bridge transfer, without waiting for the cross-chain relay to complete.

This is the first step of a bridge operation. After this call succeeds you must relay the returned `relayData` to the hub (Sonic) via `relayTxAndWaitPacket` or the intent relay API to complete the transfer. The higher-level `bridge()` method does this automatically — use `createBridgeIntent()` only when you need manual relay control.

When `raw` is `true`, returns the encoded transaction without broadcasting (useful for simulation or batching). When `raw` is `false`, signs and submits the deposit transaction via the provided wallet provider.

**Bitcoin note:** Bitcoin is only supported with `raw: false` because it requires the Bound Exchange trading wallet derivation flow.

**Chain-specific preconditions** (both fail as `VALIDATION_FAILED` with the offending `context.field`):

- **Native BTC and the dust limit.** Native BTC is denominated in satoshis and must clear the Bitcoin dust limit of `BITCOIN_DUST_SATS` (546) — outputs below it are economically unspendable and nodes reject transactions that create them. With Bitcoin as the **source**, `amount` must be at least 546. With Bitcoin as the **destination**, the *post-fee delivered* amount must clear 546: the partner fee is deducted on the hub in 18-dp vault units, so a percentage fee — or a fixed wei-denominated `PartnerFee.amount` — can push a nominally valid `amount` under the limit (`Post-fee BTC delivery (…) is below the Bitcoin dust limit`).
- **Stacks with `raw: true`** requires `extras.srcPublicKey` — see [BridgeExtras](#bridgeextras).

**Parameters:**
- `_params`: `BridgeParams<K, Raw>` — bridge parameters including source/destination chain keys, token addresses, amount, recipient, wallet provider, `raw` flag, optional `extras` (see [BridgeExtras](#bridgeextras)), and optional `skipSimulation`

**Returns:** `Promise<Result<IntentTxResult<K, Raw>>>` — on success, `{ tx, relayData }` where `tx` is the spoke deposit tx hash (or encoded call data when raw), and `relayData` contains the hub wallet address and encoded hub execution payload needed for relay.

**Example (signed):**
```typescript
import { ChainKeys } from '@sodax/sdk';

const result = await sodax.bridge.createBridgeIntent({
  params: {
    srcChainKey: ChainKeys.BASE_MAINNET,
    srcAddress: '0xYourAddress...',
    srcToken: '0x1234567890abcdef...',
    amount: 1000000000000000000n,
    dstChainKey: ChainKeys.POLYGON_MAINNET,
    dstToken: '0xabcdef1234567890...',
    recipient: '0x9876543210fedcba...',
  },
  walletProvider: evmWalletProvider,
});

if (result.ok) {
  console.log('Spoke deposit tx:', result.value.tx);
  console.log('Relay data:', result.value.relayData);
} else {
  console.error('Bridge intent creation failed:', result.error.message);
}
```

**Note:** This method only executes the transaction on the spoke chain and creates the bridge intent. To successfully bridge tokens you need to:
1. Check if the allowance is sufficient using `isAllowanceValid`
2. Approve the appropriate contract to spend the tokens using `approve`
3. Create the bridge intent using this method
4. Relay the transaction to the hub and await completion (or use the `bridge()` method which handles this automatically)

### getFee

Calculates the partner fee deducted from a given bridge input amount.

Returns `0n` when no partner fee applies. The fee is denominated in the same units as `inputAmount` (vault token decimals, 18 dp).

**Parameters:**
- `inputAmount`: `bigint` — gross amount being bridged, in 18-dp hub/vault units (the units the hub deducts the fee in — **not** the spoke token's native base units). This matters for a fixed `PartnerFee.amount`, which is wei-denominated; a percentage fee is unit-agnostic.
- `partnerFee` (optional): `PartnerFee | undefined` — fee to price against. Pass the same per-action override you will hand to `bridge()` / `createBridgeIntent()` via `extras.partnerFee` to preview its amount. Omitting the argument — or passing `undefined` explicitly, which triggers the same default — prices the configured `bridge.partnerFee`.

**Returns:** `bigint` — fee amount to be deducted, in the same units as `inputAmount`

**Example:**
```typescript
// Configured fee
const feeAmount = sodax.bridge.getFee(1000000000000000000n);

// Preview a per-action override before passing the same fee to bridge()
const previewed = sodax.bridge.getFee(1000000000000000000n, {
  address: '0xPartner...',
  percentage: 100, // 1%
});
console.log('Fee:', feeAmount.toString(), previewed.toString());
```

### getBridgeableAmount

Returns the maximum amount that can currently be bridged between two tokens, taking into account both deposit capacity on the source side and withdrawal liquidity on the destination side.

The limit type depends on the transfer direction:
- **Spoke → Hub**: constrained by the source vault's remaining deposit capacity (`DEPOSIT_LIMIT`).
- **Hub → Spoke**: constrained by the asset manager balance on the destination spoke (`WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT`).
- **Spoke → Spoke**: the minimum of the deposit capacity (source) and the asset manager balance (destination), normalised to a common unit. The returned `type` indicates which side is the binding constraint.

Returns `{ amount: 0n, type: 'DEPOSIT_LIMIT' }` when the source token is not yet supported by the vault.

**Parameters:**
- `from`: `XToken` — source token (chain key + address) to bridge from
- `to`: `XToken` — destination token (chain key + address) to bridge to

**Returns:** `Promise<Result<BridgeLimit>>` — `{ amount, decimals, type }` where `amount` is the maximum bridgeable quantity in the token's native base units and `decimals` is its decimal precision.

**Example:**
```typescript
import { ChainKeys } from '@sodax/sdk';

const result = await sodax.bridge.getBridgeableAmount(
  {
    address: '0x1234567890abcdef...',
    chainKey: ChainKeys.BASE_MAINNET,
    symbol: 'USDC',
    name: 'USD Coin',
    decimals: 6,
  },
  {
    address: '0xabcdef1234567890...',
    chainKey: ChainKeys.POLYGON_MAINNET,
    symbol: 'USDC',
    name: 'USD Coin',
    decimals: 6,
  },
);

if (result.ok) {
  console.log('Max bridgeable:', result.value.amount.toString());
  console.log('Decimals:', result.value.decimals);
  console.log('Limit type:', result.value.type); // 'DEPOSIT_LIMIT' | 'WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT'
} else {
  console.error('Error getting bridgeable amount:', result.error);
}
```

### isBridgeable

Determines whether two tokens (potentially on different chains) can be bridged to each other.

Two tokens are bridgeable if they resolve to the same vault address on the Sonic hub, meaning they represent the same underlying asset across chains (e.g. USDC on Base and USDC on Arbitrum both map to the same hub vault).

Returns `false` — rather than throwing — on any resolution or validation error.

**Parameters:**
- `from`: `XToken` — source token to bridge from
- `to`: `XToken` — destination token to bridge to
- `unchecked`: `boolean` (optional, default `false`) — when `true`, skips the `isValidSpokeChainKey` guard. Useful for checking theoretical bridgeability without requiring both chains to be in the active config.

**Returns:** `boolean` — `true` if the tokens share the same hub vault; `false` otherwise.

**Example:**
```typescript
import { ChainKeys } from '@sodax/sdk';

const isBridgeable = sodax.bridge.isBridgeable({
  from: {
    address: '0x1234567890abcdef...',
    chainKey: ChainKeys.BASE_MAINNET,
    symbol: 'USDC',
    name: 'USD Coin',
    decimals: 6,
  },
  to: {
    address: '0xabcdef1234567890...',
    chainKey: ChainKeys.POLYGON_MAINNET,
    symbol: 'USDC',
    name: 'USD Coin',
    decimals: 6,
  },
});

console.log('Assets are bridgeable:', isBridgeable);
```

### getBridgeableTokens

Returns all tokens on the destination chain that can receive a bridge from the given source token. Filters the destination chain's supported tokens to those that share the same hub vault as the source token.

**Parameters:**
- `from`: `SpokeChainKey` — source chain key
- `to`: `SpokeChainKey` — destination chain key whose supported tokens are searched
- `token`: `string` — source token address on `from`

**Returns:** `Result<XToken[]>` — array of destination-chain tokens bridgeable from the source token; error result if the source token is not found in config.

**Example:**
```typescript
import { ChainKeys } from '@sodax/sdk';

const result = sodax.bridge.getBridgeableTokens(
  ChainKeys.BASE_MAINNET,
  ChainKeys.POLYGON_MAINNET,
  '0x1234567890abcdef...',
);

if (result.ok) {
  console.log('Bridgeable tokens on Polygon:', result.value);
} else {
  console.error('Error getting bridgeable tokens:', result.error);
}
```

## Types

### CreateBridgeIntentParams

```typescript
export type CreateBridgeIntentParams<K extends SpokeChainKey = SpokeChainKey> = {
  srcAddress: string;
  srcChainKey: K;
  srcToken: string;
  amount: bigint;
  dstChainKey: SpokeChainKey;
  dstToken: string;
  recipient: string; // non-encoded recipient address
};
```

### BridgeParams

`BridgeParams` is an alias for `SpokeExecActionParams`, which is a discriminated union combining the intent params with the `WalletProviderSlot`:

```typescript
export type BridgeParams<ChainKey extends SpokeChainKey, Raw extends boolean> = SpokeExecActionParams<
  ChainKey,
  Raw,
  CreateBridgeIntentParams<ChainKey>,
  BridgeExtras<ChainKey>
>;
```

`SpokeExecActionParams` contributes `params`, the optional `extras` slot (see below), `skipSimulation`, `timeout`, and the wallet-provider slot. `timeout` is a per-attempt budget — see [Completion paths and `timeout`](#completion-paths-and-timeout).

The `WalletProviderSlot<K, Raw>` discriminant enforces at compile time:
- `{ raw: true }` — `walletProvider` is **forbidden**; returns raw tx payload
- `{ raw: false, walletProvider: GetWalletProviderType<K> }` — `walletProvider` is **required** and chain-narrowed; signs and broadcasts

### BridgeExtras

Per-action extras passed via the `extras` slot of `bridge()` / `createBridgeIntent()`. The chain-specific slots are keyed off `K`, so a non-Stacks action cannot set `srcPublicKey` and a non-Bitcoin action cannot set `bound`:

```typescript
export type BridgeExtras<K extends SpokeChainKey = SpokeChainKey> = (GetChainType<K> extends 'STACKS'
  ? { srcPublicKey?: string }
  : { srcPublicKey?: never }) &
  (GetChainType<K> extends 'BITCOIN' ? { bound?: BitcoinBoundExtras } : { bound?: never }) & {
    partnerFee?: PartnerFee;
  };
```

- `partnerFee` — chain-agnostic per-action fee override. When present it takes precedence over the config-level `bridge.partnerFee` for that call, letting an integrator charge and route its own fee per bridge. Omit to use the configured fee. Preview the amount with `getFee(inputAmount, partnerFee)`.
- `srcPublicKey` — **required** for Stacks sources with `raw: true`. A Stacks address cannot yield the signer public key at raw-tx build time, so the unsigned tx needs it up front; omitting it fails with `VALIDATION_FAILED` (`context.field: 'srcPublicKey'`).
- `bound` — Bound Exchange (Radfi) inputs for raw Bitcoin TRADING-mode sources: `{ accessToken?: string }`, falling back to the `RadfiProvider` instance token when omitted.

```typescript
const result = await sodax.bridge.bridge({
  params: { /* … */ },
  raw: false,
  walletProvider: evmWalletProvider,
  extras: { partnerFee: { address: '0xPartner...', percentage: 100 } },
});
```

### BridgeLimit

```typescript
type BridgeLimit = {
  amount: bigint;
  decimals: number;
  type: 'DEPOSIT_LIMIT' | 'WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT';
};
```

### TxHashPair

```typescript
type TxHashPair = {
  srcChainTxHash: string;
  dstChainTxHash: string;
};
```

### PartnerFee

A percentage fee or a fixed amount:

```typescript
type PartnerFee = PartnerFeeAmount | PartnerFeePercentage;

type PartnerFeePercentage = {
  address: string;
  percentage: number; // 100 = 1%, 10000 = 100% (FEE_PERCENTAGE_SCALE)
};

type PartnerFeeAmount = {
  address: string;
  amount: bigint; // fixed amount, subtracted directly — so it must be in the same units as the
                  // amount it is charged against (for bridge: 18-dp hub/vault units, not spoke units)
};
```

## Error Handling

The Bridge module's user-facing methods return `Promise<Result<T, SodaxError<NarrowCode>>>`. Discriminate on `result.error.code` (a string literal) — never on `result.error.message`. Same canonical shape used by swap and money market.

### The canonical error: `SodaxError<C>`

All bridge-module errors are instances of `SodaxError`, exported from `@sodax/sdk`:

```typescript
import { SodaxError, isSodaxError } from '@sodax/sdk';

class SodaxError<C extends string = string> extends Error {
  readonly code: C;                         // string-literal discriminator
  readonly cause?: unknown;                 // ES2022 cause chain
  readonly context?: Record<string, unknown>;
  toJSON(): { name, code, message, stack, context, cause };
}
```

**Rules:**

- Discriminate on `error.code` — never on `error.message` (which is human-readable, may change).
- `error.cause` walks the underlying error chain (loggers like Sentry/Pino/Datadog walk this automatically).
- `error.context` carries structured metadata: `srcChainKey`, `dstChainKey`, `phase`, plus per-code extras (`relayCode`, `field`).
- `error.toJSON()` is the canonical logger surface; `JSON.stringify(error)` invokes it automatically and produces a logger-safe payload (bigints in `context` are coerced to strings, cause walked depth-3, no circular hazards).
- Use `isBridgeError(e)` (broad) or one of the narrow guards `isBridgeOrchestrationError(e)` / `isBridgeCreateIntentError(e)` / `isBridgeApproveError(e)` / `isBridgeAllowanceCheckError(e)` / `isBridgeLookupError(e)` from `@sodax/sdk` instead of `instanceof SodaxError` in dapp/app code (bundle-safe).

### Per-method error code unions

| Method | Codes |
|---|---|
| `bridge` | `USER_REJECTED`, `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `INTENT_CREATION_FAILED`, `TX_VERIFICATION_FAILED`, `TX_SUBMIT_FAILED`, `RELAY_TIMEOUT`, `RELAY_FAILED`, `EXECUTION_FAILED`, `UNKNOWN` |
| `createBridgeIntent` | `USER_REJECTED`, `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `INTENT_CREATION_FAILED`, `UNKNOWN` |
| `approve` | `USER_REJECTED`, `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `APPROVE_FAILED`, `UNKNOWN` |
| `isAllowanceValid` | `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `ALLOWANCE_CHECK_FAILED`, `UNKNOWN` |
| `getBridgeableAmount` | `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `LOOKUP_FAILED`, `UNKNOWN` |
| `getBridgeableTokens` | `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `LOOKUP_FAILED`, `UNKNOWN` |

**Important:** `bridge` orchestrates verify + relay only on the **client-side path** (the fallback, or `useBackendSubmitTx: false`), so `TX_VERIFICATION_FAILED`, `TX_SUBMIT_FAILED`, `RELAY_TIMEOUT` and `RELAY_FAILED` never surface on a bridge the backend completes. When the backend attempt does not complete, its own error is logged and discarded — the fallback runs and its outcome is what you receive, so the code you see always describes the client-side attempt, never the backend one. Check the logs, not the `Result`, to tell why the backend path was abandoned. See [Completion paths and `timeout`](#completion-paths-and-timeout).

The exported narrow types are `BridgeOrchestrationError` (for `bridge`), `BridgeCreateIntentError` (for `createBridgeIntent`), `BridgeApproveError`, `BridgeAllowanceCheckError`, and a single `BridgeLookupError` shared by `getBridgeableAmount` and `getBridgeableTokens` (discriminate them at runtime via `error.context.method`). Each has a matching narrow guard listed above.

### Standard `context` fields

```typescript
{
  srcChainKey?: SpokeChainKey;
  dstChainKey?: SpokeChainKey;
  phase?: 'validate' | 'intentCreation' | 'verify' | 'submit' | 'relay'
        | 'approve' | 'allowanceCheck' | 'lookup';
  relayCode?: 'SUBMIT_TX_FAILED' | 'RELAY_TIMEOUT' | 'RELAY_POLLING_FAILED' | 'UNKNOWN';
  field?: string;     // on VALIDATION_FAILED
  reason?: string;
}
```

### Discrimination example

```typescript
import { isBridgeOrchestrationError } from '@sodax/sdk';

const result = await sodax.bridge.bridge({
  params: { /* ... */ },
  raw: false,
  walletProvider: evmWalletProvider,
});

if (!result.ok) {
  // result.error is BridgeOrchestrationError = SodaxError<BridgeOrchestrationErrorCode>
  switch (result.error.code) {
    case 'VALIDATION_FAILED':
      // Bad input — error.message is human-readable; error.context.field tells you which.
      console.error('Bad input:', result.error.message);

### Migration from the legacy pattern

If you were on the previous CODE-on-`error.message` pattern (or the older `BridgeError<Code>` typed shape that the published docs [document](https://docs.sodax.com/developers/packages/foundation/sdk/functional-modules/bridge#error-handling)), here are the mappings:

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `error.message === 'RELAY_TIMEOUT'` | `error.code === 'RELAY_TIMEOUT'` |
| `error.message === 'SUBMIT_TX_FAILED'` | `error.code === 'TX_SUBMIT_FAILED'` |
| `error.message === 'CREATE_BRIDGE_INTENT_FAILED'` | `error.code === 'INTENT_CREATION_FAILED'` |
| `error.message === 'EXECUTION_FAILED'` | `error.code === 'EXECUTION_FAILED'` (now narrow-typed) |
| `error.message === 'ALLOWANCE_CHECK_FAILED'` | `error.code === 'ALLOWANCE_CHECK_FAILED'` |
| `error.message === 'APPROVAL_FAILED'` | `error.code === 'APPROVE_FAILED'` |
| Prose `error.message` for invariants | `error.code === 'VALIDATION_FAILED'`; the prose stays on `error.message` |

### Best practices

1. **Always handle `TX_SUBMIT_FAILED`**. Critical — the spoke tx landed but the relay submission failed. Funds may be in flight; persist the user's input and retry.
2. **Handle `RELAY_TIMEOUT` gracefully**. The spoke tx succeeded; the relay just didn't deliver in time. Check on-chain status before retrying.
3. **Discriminate `RELAY_FAILED` via `context.relayCode`**. `'RELAY_POLLING_FAILED'` (polling outage — packet status unknown) needs different UX from generic `'UNKNOWN'`.
4. **Use `error.cause` for forensics**. Every wrapped error preserves the original on `cause`. Loggers walk it automatically.
5. **Use `JSON.stringify(error)` for logging**. The `toJSON()` method handles bigint coercion + cause-chain truncation safely.
6. **Type-guard, don't `as`-cast**. Use `is<Op>Error(error)` to narrow; an `as <Op>Error` cast after a generic `isSodaxError` check would silently widen the contract.

## Usage Flow

The typical bridge operation follows this sequence:

1. **Check allowance** using `isAllowanceValid()`
2. **Approve tokens** using `approve()` if needed
3. **For Stellar destination chains**: check and establish trustlines (see [Stellar Trustline Requirements](https://github.com/icon-project/sodax-sdks/blob/main/packages/sdk/docs/STELLAR_TRUSTLINE.md#bridge))
4. **Execute bridge** using `bridge()` for the full lifecycle, or `createBridgeIntent()` for manual relay control
5. **Monitor progress** using the returned transaction hashes

## Chain Keys

Use `ChainKeys.*` constants from `@sodax/sdk` instead of raw string chain IDs:

```typescript
import { ChainKeys } from '@sodax/sdk';

// Examples
ChainKeys.BASE_MAINNET      // '0x2105.base'
ChainKeys.POLYGON_MAINNET   // '0x89.polygon'
ChainKeys.SONIC_MAINNET     // hub chain
ChainKeys.ETHEREUM_MAINNET
ChainKeys.ARBITRUM_MAINNET
// ... all 20 supported chains
```

The chain key in the request payload (e.g. `srcChainKey`) drives both TypeScript narrowing — so `walletProvider` is automatically typed to the correct interface — and runtime routing inside the SDK.

## Supported Chains

The service supports all 21 chains in the SODAX network:
- **EVM (13):** Sonic (hub), Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, BSC, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, HyperEVM, Lightlink, Redbelly, Kaia, Hedera
- **Non-EVM (8):** Solana, Sui, Stellar, ICON, Injective, NEAR, Stacks, Bitcoin

## Partner Fees

Partner fees are configured at `Sodax` construction time via `config.bridge.partnerFee`. They are automatically applied inside `bridge()` and `createBridgeIntent()`. Use `getFee()` to preview the fee amount for a given input:

```typescript
const feeAmount = sodax.bridge.getFee(inputAmount);
const netAmount = inputAmount - feeAmount;
```

A single bridge can override the configured fee via `extras.partnerFee` (see [BridgeExtras](#bridgeextras)). Pass the same fee as `getFee`'s second argument to preview that override:

```typescript
const perActionFee = { address: '0xPartner...', percentage: 100 }; // 1%
const feeAmount = sodax.bridge.getFee(inputAmount, perActionFee);

const result = await sodax.bridge.bridge({
  params: { /* … */ },
  raw: false,
  walletProvider: evmWalletProvider,
  extras: { partnerFee: perActionFee },
});
```

Fees are denominated in vault token decimals (18 dp).

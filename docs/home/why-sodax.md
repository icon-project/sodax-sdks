SODAX is a modular execution system. Integrate each SDK module on its own, or combine them.

### What you can build

| Partner Type | What you can build with SODAX |
| --- | --- |
| **Wallets** | Use **Swaps** to offer cross-network intents in your UI, plus **Bridge** primitives where needed for asset transfer. Use **Lend / Borrow (Money Market)** to integrate lending primitives. |
| **DEXs & Aggregators** | Use **Swaps** to quote and execute cross-network intents and expand beyond single-network liquidity. |
| **Lending Protocols** | Use **Lend / Borrow (Money Market)** to integrate lending primitives and support multi-network user flows around collateral and borrowing. |
| **Perp DEXs / Yield Apps** | Use **Swaps** to accept deposits from other networks via swap-into-your-asset flows, then complete the deposit inside your app. Use **Lend / Borrow (Money Market)** to enable borrowed asset deposits with user collateral on other networks. |
| **New Networks** | Integrate SODAX to provide builders with ready-made cross-network execution capabilities and liquidity access from day one. |

### Why it fits

* **Execution beyond routing.** Routes move assets. SODAX routes and settles; solvers fill so swaps, borrows, and deposits can complete across networks.
* **One SDK, modular usage.** Integrate @sodax/sdk once, then use only the modules you need.
* **Built for real execution conditions.** Asynchronous by nature, with explicit timeouts and clear completion or failure handling.
* **Your control preserved.** You keep ownership of user experience, pricing logic, and risk parameters.
* **Proven in production.** Live cross-network flows across heterogeneous networks, settled by the protocol and filled by independent solvers.

### Ecosystem reach

Live homepage figures refresh from public config (`api.sodax.com`). Approximate capacity:

* **Networks:** 21+ spanning EVM and non-EVM — including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon, Sonic, Solana, Sui, Stellar, Injective, ICON, Near, Stacks, Bitcoin, HyperEVM, LightLink, Redbelly, Kaia, and Hedera (live list from `/config/spoke/chains`).
* **Money market:** 30+ reserve assets available for lending and borrowing across networks.
* **Swap tokens:** 137+ distinct symbols supported for intent swaps.
* **Audits:** 8 published reports — see [Audit reports](/developers/audits).
* **Liquidity access:** SODAX protocol venues — the money market, the AMM, and the intent contracts — are infrastructure that approved solvers can access when they fill. Solvers source and commit their own capital (see [solver-compatible assets](/developers/deployments/swaps-compatible-assets)).
* **Infrastructure compatibility:** designed to work alongside major messaging standards (GMP) for secure intent propagation, not replace them.

Together, SODAX provides the execution infrastructure required for modern money across networks.

 * Direct `@sodax/swaps-api` client for this page. Unlike the rest of the demo (which reaches the
 * swaps backend through `sodax.api.swaps` / dapp-kit hooks), this page drives the original wire
 * client itself — dapp-kit stays involved only for wallet/signing and chain-prerequisite concerns
 * the API doesn't cover.
 *
 * Base URL and key come from the same effective settings the provider hands the SDK, because the
 * page's order-status panel polls through `sodax.api.swaps`: a client configured on its own would
 * submit to one deployment and poll another, leaving every order pending. A hook rather than a
 * module singleton because the Sodax Settings modal changes both at runtime.
 *
 * `timeout` is not optional in practice: the package omits it by default, meaning no deadline at
 * all, so a stalled request would hang a quote or the swap dialog with nothing to recover from.
 * The SDK path applies `DEFAULT_BACKEND_API_TIMEOUT` — reused here rather than restated.

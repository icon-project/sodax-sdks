/**
 * Pending-operation banner with a cancel.
 *
 * A position allows one intent at a time, so while something is in flight every other control is
 * unusable — that state needs to be visible rather than expressed only as disabled buttons. Cancel
 * is the escape hatch when no solver fills: it drops the grant the hook was given, cancels the
 * intent, and returns anything the position is holding loose to the owner. A position carrying no
 * debt also withdraws its whole collateral balance back, which is what a leveraged open whose intent
 * never filled needs.
 *
 * Cancelling before the deadline is allowed and is the owner's call to make. After the deadline the
 * intent is cancellable by anyone, which resolves the intent without the position being told — so the
 * slot stays occupied until someone settles. Nothing notifies it; that is what `needsSettle` is for.
 *
 * Settle is also the second half of a close that exited into the debt token: the fill leaves the
 * surplus sitting in the position, and this sweep is what delivers it to the owner.

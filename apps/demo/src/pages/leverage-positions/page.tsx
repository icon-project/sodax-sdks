/**
 * Leverage Positions page.
 *
 * The unpooled counterpart to /leverage-yield. A vault is one shared ERC-4626 position at a
 * single target LTV; a leverage position is one AAVE account per owner, so an owner can hold
 * several at different eMode categories and leverage tiers at once.
 *
 * Positions are owned by the user's **hub wallet**, never their EOA — the wallet router for a
 * Sonic user, the cross-chain wallet for a spoke user, both resolved by the one
 * `useGetUserHubWalletAddress` call. That is what makes this page chain-agnostic: nothing here
 * is special-cased for Sonic.

/**
 * Close-position control.
 *
 * Closing means clearing the debt, and clearing the debt means selling collateral through a solver —
 * so it is never one transaction, and the UI is shaped around that rather than hiding it. What the
 * user gets to choose is which asset they leave with:
 *
 *   EXIT INTO COLLATERAL — sell only as much collateral as the debt is worth, then withdraw the rest.
 *     Two steps, and the withdrawal can pay out to any address, so it goes to the signer's own wallet.
 *
 *   EXIT INTO THE DEBT TOKEN — sell the whole collateral balance in one go. The solver delivers more
 *     debt token than is owed, the hook repays the debt and leaves the surplus in the position, and
 *     `settle` sweeps it to the position's owner. That is the natural exit for someone who arrived
 *     from the debt side and wants the same asset back rather than the collateral.
 *
 * Both are the same `decreaseLeverage` call; the difference is only how much collateral it sells.
 *
 * Phases are driven by the position's own state rather than local flags, so a reload or a fill that
 * lands while the page is closed picks up where it left off:
 *
 *   1. debt > 0      → sell collateral to repay it
 *   2. debt == 0     → withdraw whatever collateral is left (nothing to do after a full exit)
 *
 * WHY A FULL EXIT CANNOT HALF-HAPPEN: the hook repays the debt and then withdraws all the collateral
 * to pay the solver. If the delivered amount fell short of the debt, that withdrawal would leave debt
 * standing against no collateral, and the pool's health-factor check rejects it — the whole fill
 * reverts and the position is untouched. So a full exit either clears the debt or does nothing, which
 * is also why this blocks rather than posts when the quote would not cover the debt.

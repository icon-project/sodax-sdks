# Lessons

Patterns to apply on future work in this repo. Added after a correction; each one states the rule, not
the incident.

---

## L1 — Prove arithmetic by running it, never by reasoning about it

**Correction:** asserted that the encoding was monotonic across rc and stable versions without having
executed it. Twice shipped a wrong number in prose: the int32 ceiling stated as major ≤ 2147 when
`encode(2147.99.99) = 2_147_999_999` overflows (real ceiling 2146), and `0.1.0` described as "below
published counter values" when it encodes to `10099`, which is above `235`.

**Rule:** any claim of the form "this ordering holds", "this fits in N bits", "this value is greater
than that one" gets a throwaway script before it gets written down. At *design time*, reach for the
cheapest thing that would actually catch an error — enumerating 4,000,000 cases took under a second and
beat a hand-picked table of eight. Then decide separately what belongs in the suite; the two questions
have different answers (see L10). Every number that survives into the written design should be one the
script printed.

## L2 — State which invariant, when there is more than one

**Correction:** "ensure that at no point can the derived number fail the core invariant of being
properly incremented."

**Rule:** "monotonic" was ambiguous between *semver order* and *publish order*, and the design could
only guarantee the first. Naming them separately (I1/I2) turned a hand-wave into a decision: the drift
gate needs semver order, the backport case breaks publish order, and that is correct rather than a bug.
When a guarantee has an exception, find out whether the exception is the *right* behaviour before
treating it as a hole to plug.

## L3 — Guards that fail silently must throw, and the boundary must be tested

**Rule:** when a scheme has a domain (field widths, sentinels, ranges), check what happens **one past**
each boundary, not just inside it. Here every cap was exactly load-bearing: at the boundary ordering
held, one past it the value collided or inverted with nothing to surface it at runtime. That asymmetry
is the argument for throwing per field with a message naming the remedy, and for a test case per cap.

## L4 — A decoder's input is untrusted; bound it on both ends

**Rule:** a lower bound alone let `decode(MAX_SAFE_INTEGER + 1)` return a plausible-looking object.
Anything parsing a value that arrives over the wire needs both bounds plus an integer check, and must
return `null` rather than throw — a throw inside a config path is the wrong failure mode. Note the
deliberate asymmetry with the write side: writing a bad value must stop a release loudly.

## L5 — Ask who consumes the thing, not just who produces it

**Correction:** "have you taken into account that apps might like to get the current config version?"

**Rule:** the first design covered the release tooling end to end and left consumers with a bare
integer. When changing an exported value's meaning, work out what a consumer now wants to *do* with it
before calling the design complete. Here it added three exports and changed where the decode logic has
to live.

## L6 — Changing a file means re-reading what else touches that file

**Rule:** the release script's `CONFIG_VERSION` seds are unanchored — they match any identifier ending
in `CONFIG_VERSION` and the read takes the file's first hit. A design that adds constants to that same
file would have silently corrupted the release, and every existing check would still have passed. Before
adding to a file, grep for what parses it. Textual tooling (sed, regex codemods) is the usual culprit.

## L7 — Verify the repo's real state; branches lie

**Rule:** `main` and `release` disagree on both the package version and `CONFIG_VERSION`, and `main` has
been stale since August. Reading the checked-out branch and generalising would have produced a design
built on `100` instead of the published `235`. Check the branch that actually ships (`git show
origin/<branch>:<path>`), and check what CI actually runs on — `ci.yml` never runs on `release`, which
is what forced the verification to live in the publish workflow rather than in a test.

## L8 — Ask about system facts outside the repo; do not infer them

**Corrections:** assumed the backend *maintained* its own `version` number (it re-exposes
`CONFIG_VERSION` from the SDK package it imports), and assumed the compatibility rule would stay the
`<` that the commented-out code happens to contain (the selected policy is exact equality, `!==`).

**Rule:** the repo is authoritative about the repo. It is not authoritative about what another service
does with a value, or about a policy that has been decided but not yet written down — commented-out
code is the *old* intent, not evidence of the current one. Both assumptions propagated through several
sections before being caught. When a design depends on a fact that lives outside the tree, ask, and
mark it as assumed until answered. Both corrections here *simplified* the design: no backend
coordination is needed, and equality makes ordering non-load-bearing.

## L9 — Match the invariant to the actual comparison

**Rule:** switching the gate from `<` to `!==` changed which property carries the correctness weight:
ordering became decorative and **injectivity** became the thing that must not break. The same caps
turned out to be load-bearing either way, but for a different reason — a collision under equality means
accepting config built for a different release, which is worse than an inversion. Work out which
property the consuming comparison actually reads before deciding what to prove and what to test.

## L10 — Boundary and property tests beat bulk enumeration

**Correction:** a 4,000,000-case exhaustive sweep was proposed as a permanent test.

**Rule:** enumeration is a fine one-off proof while designing, and a poor suite member — it costs
runtime and maintenance and finds nothing the boundaries do not. For a positional encoding the failure
modes live at the carries, so the durable tests are: successor pairs straddling each field boundary
(asserting the *gap*, not just the order), plus seeded property tests for injectivity, round trip, and
agreement with the existing comparator. Keep the one-off in the design notes, not in CI.

## L11 — Conventional branch names, and the type carries meaning

**Correction:** used `chore/` for work that adds public runtime exports.

**Rule:** `<type>/<few-hyphen-separated-words>`. The type is a claim about impact, not a formality:
new public API is `feat/`, even when most of the diff is tooling and docs. Commit subjects follow
conventional commits; the husky `commit-msg` hook enforces the format.

# AGENTS.md

Repository navigation hub for coding agents. Keep this file slim: it is loaded for nearly every task. Read the package or app `AGENTS.md` that owns the files you will touch before making changes.

## Project Overview

SODAX is a cross-chain DeFi SDK monorepo built around a hub-and-spoke architecture with Sonic as the hub chain. The SDK surface covers swaps, lending/borrowing, staking, bridging, concentrated-liquidity DEX flows, token migration, partner fee operations, and recovery flows across EVM and non-EVM ecosystems.

Do not hardcode supported chain counts or chain lists in agent guidance. When exact support matters, inspect the source of truth in `@sodax/types`, package source, or generated docs.

### Docs site

`docs/` is the docs.sodax.com Mintlify site, built from this repo by Mintlify's GitHub App: a page merged here is published, and one pushed to a branch gets a preview URL on the PR. Read [`docs/AGENTS.md`](docs/AGENTS.md) before adding, moving or renaming a page — paths are URLs, and `docs.json` navigation is what makes a page reachable. Gates: `pnpm check:docs-nav` and `pnpm docs:validate`.

## Dependency Direction

- `@sodax/types` has no package dependencies.
- `@sodax/swaps-api` depends on `@sodax/types` (and `valibot`) — a standalone swaps-API wire client with no dependency on `@sodax/sdk`.
- `@sodax/sdk` depends on `@sodax/types` and `@sodax/swaps-api` (its `SwapsApiService` wraps the latter) and re-exports public shared types.
- `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core` depends on `@sodax/types`.
- `@sodax/wallet-sdk-react` depends on `@sodax/types` and `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core`.
- `@sodax/dapp-kit` depends on `@sodax/sdk` and imports wallet-provider contracts through SDK/type exports.
- `@sodax/skills` is markdown/package metadata only and must not depend on runtime SDK packages.

Respect these boundaries when adding imports. If a change seems to need a reverse dependency, stop and find the package-level pattern first.

## Common Commands

Use the package manager declared in `package.json`.

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm build:packages
pnpm build
pnpm lint
pnpm pretty
pnpm checkTs
pnpm test
pnpm check:ai
```

For a single package:

```bash
cd packages/<pkg> && pnpm test
cd packages/<pkg> && pnpm test:e2e
cd packages/<pkg> && pnpm coverage
cd packages/<pkg> && npx vitest run path/to/test.test.ts
```

To try unreleased `@sodax/*` packages in a project outside this repo, pack them into local
tarballs — plain `pnpm pack` is not enough, because it rewrites `workspace:*` to a registry
version. See [`docs/local-package-testing.md`](docs/local-package-testing.md).

```bash
pnpm pack:local --version 2.0.0-local.1 --packages @sodax/sdk
```

## Repo-Wide Rules

- Keep changes scoped to the requested task. Do not refactor, restyle, rename, or expand nearby code unless it is required for correctness.
- Read the nearest package/app `AGENTS.md` before editing under that subtree.
- SDK package sources use `.js` extensions in relative imports because dual ESM/CJS output resolves them at build time.
- Biome is the only formatter/linter. Do not add ESLint or Prettier config.
- Build order matters: packages build before apps.
- Commits must follow conventional commit format and must not include AI-tool attribution.
- Do not add exact chain counts, issue-era history, or current-state claims to agent guidance unless the statement is stable and source-of-truth-backed.

## Working Rules (planning + code quality)

These guide every change. Where a rule maps to tooling (types, lint, tests, `check:ai-*`), CI is the backstop; the rest are review-enforced. Before reporting a change done, run the relevant check and trust its real output over assumption.

- **Verify against current source.** Confirm every claim against `src/` before writing; do not rely on memory or older commits/PRs (the codebase refactors). If a fact is unverified, mark it so or ask.
- **Don't assume — ask when ambiguous.** If a required input or the scope is missing or unclear, stop and ask the requester or the source of truth rather than guessing.
- **Use the established skill/pattern.** Adding a token or chain → use the `add-token` / `add-chain` skill (`.claude/skills/`); don't wire it ad-hoc. Start from the nearest existing implementation.
- **Branch by case; don't over-generalize.** Chain/token work differs by family and feature (e.g. EVM vs non-EVM); verify the specific case instead of copying one onto another.
- **Source-derived config.** Token/chain config is source-of-truth in `@sodax/types` / backend — never hardcode chain or token lists in feature code.
- **No escape hatches.** Don't use `any`, `@ts-ignore`, non-null `!`, or unsafe casts to silence type/quality checks; fix the underlying type. (Existing `biome.json` overrides are tracked tech debt, not a license.)
- **Never commit or hardcode secrets.** Keep private keys, mnemonics, and RPC credentials in env vars (`process.env` / git-ignored `.env`, with `.env.example` placeholders) the way the `apps/node` smoke scripts do — never inline a real key, paste one into a sample, or log it. If a task needs a secret, stop and ask.
- **Fix the gate, don't game it.** Don't skip or disable tests (`.only`, `.skip`, deleted assertions), blanket-suppress lint, or bypass the husky pre-commit / commit-msg hooks (`--no-verify`, force-push) to go green. If a check fails, fix the cause or stop and report it — silencing it just hides the regression.
- **Preserve package boundaries.** Keep dependency direction intact and put reusable logic in the package/domain that owns it; don't hide cross-package coupling in callers.
- **Add dependencies deliberately.** Don't pull in a new runtime dependency for something the repo already covers; prefer existing utilities and the curated re-export subpaths in `packages/libs`. If a third-party dep is genuinely needed, isolate it through `packages/libs` and say why.
- **Keep feature services lean.** Feature-service code stays core feature logic; move reusable utilities and chain-specific work to `utils/`, entities, wallet providers, or spoke services. Extract a helper when it is genuinely shared, not as a speculative single-use abstraction.
- **Code is the source of truth — comment sparingly.** Make the code self-explanatory (clear names, small functions) instead of explaining it in prose. Add a comment only when confidence is high that the code cannot carry the point: a non-obvious constraint, invariant, or decision — then **1 line (preferred), 2 lines max**. The only exception is a function/class/type-level doc comment, which may be longer. Never narrate what the code or config already says, never leave commented-out code, and never add multi-row inline blocks — they bloat the file and drift out of sync with the code.
- **Cover new code with meaningful tests.** Add or extend tests for core flows, invariants, edge cases, and chain/feature matrices beside the changed code; don't rely on superficial coverage.
- **Keep AI docs faithful.** `packages/skills` teaches *partner* agents how to call the public API; it is not where we introduce a feature (that is `.claude/skills/` plus `packages/sdk/docs/`). When public behavior, imports, signatures, examples, chains, tokens, or feature support change, update `packages/skills` and run `pnpm check:ai`. That does not satisfy Docs Drift.
- **Docs generated into docs.sodax.com keep absolute links.** `scripts/docs-pages-map.json` maps the READMEs and `packages/sdk/docs` pages that `pnpm docs:sync-pages` generates into `docs/`, moving and renaming them on the way. In those sources a link may stay relative only when the target lands in the same destination directory under the same filename; every other target (moved doc, ungenerated doc, source file, directory) needs an absolute `https://github.com/icon-project/sodax-sdks/blob/main/…` URL, and never a `sodax-document` URL. Gate: `pnpm check:doc-links`.
- **New published docs must also be in nav.** Every mapped `src` is published, but that alone does not make it discoverable: its `dest` needs a matching entry in `docs/docs.json`, or the page is live but absent from the sidebar and from search. Gate: `pnpm check:docs-nav` — Docs Drift does not check nav.

**Definition of done:** scoped diff · behavior verified against `src/` · relevant `test`/`checkTs`/`lint`/`check:ai` green · mapped docs when package `src/` changed · `packages/skills` updated when public behavior changed · no unrelated refactor.

To review a change against these rules, use the `review-core-sdk` skill (`.claude/skills/review-core-sdk/`).

To cut a release, follow [`packages/RELEASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](packages/RELEASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md). `pnpm release` prompts for the version and applies it; committing, tagging, and publishing stay human steps.

## AI File Maintenance

- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical shared agent guidance. `CLAUDE.md` files should be thin Claude-specific shims that import the sibling `AGENTS.md`.
- Dev skills are authored and committed under `.claude/skills/` (the canonical copy). The `.agents/skills/` (Codex) and `.github/skills/` (Copilot) mirrors are gitignored and regenerated locally by the Vercel `skills` CLI (`npx skills`); native Codex/Copilot auto-trigger needs that local sync, while the `AGENTS.md` skill pointers work without it. Edit the skill in `.claude/skills/`, never a generated mirror.
- Root guidance is for information every domain needs. Put package/app-specific architecture, patterns, commands, and pitfalls in that subtree's `AGENTS.md`.
- Prefer broad durable patterns over volatile enumerations. When exact values matter, point agents to source files or package docs rather than copying values.
- Validate changes to these files with `pnpm check:ai-dev-files`.
- When a pull request changes source that an AI file describes, a read-only agent compares that guidance against the source and reports guidance the current source disproves. Missing coverage is advisory, and so is the whole check until the `AI_DRIFT_ENFORCE` repository variable is set. Label a pull request `no-ai-drift` to skip it when a finding is wrong.
- When a generated doc is added, renamed, or removed, update its `scripts/docs-pages-map.json` entry — every mapped src is published — and the `docs.json` nav entry for its `dest` together, then run `pnpm docs:sync-pages`. Gates: `pnpm check:docs-pages` and `pnpm check:docs-nav`.

## CI Shape

The `Build and Test` job installs dependencies with a frozen lockfile, lints, checks circular dependencies, builds packages, typechecks, validates AI consumer docs, builds apps, runs smoke checks, and runs tests. When changing `packages/skills`, run `pnpm check:ai` locally. Among those tests is the logo gate: `packages/types/src/chains/logo-assets.test.ts` fails a chain or token added without its PNG in `packages/assets` (and a PNG no chain or token claims), which is why `packages/types/turbo.json` lists the asset directories in its `test` inputs — `packages/assets` is not a dependency, so otherwise a deleted logo would replay a cached green run.

A separate `Docs site` job runs on every pull request and holds the docs gates: `check:doc-links`, `check:docs-nav`, `check:docs-pages` and `check:ai-dev-files` (all node-builtin scripts, no install), then `mint validate` and `mint broken-links` through `pnpm dlx` at a pinned version. `broken-links` is the only check that catches a relative link, and the only one that opens the hand-written pages at all. Run `pnpm docs:validate` locally too — it needs the `mint` CLI on your PATH.

A `Detect changed paths` job decides whether `Build and Test` runs: a pull request touching only `docs/` skips it, and `Docs site` still gates the change. It is a job-level `if:` rather than a workflow `paths-ignore` on purpose — a path-filtered workflow never reports, so a required check would sit pending forever.

A `Docs auto-merge` workflow approves and squash-merges a pull request that changes only marketing's docs pages, once `Docs site` is green, so marketing publishes from the Mintlify dashboard without a reviewer. `.github/scripts/classify-docs-pr.sh` decides from an allowlist of the Home, Solutions, Community and Help tabs, and fails closed: the developer reference (`docs/developers/` except `faq`, and `docs/solana/`), `docs.json`, a `generatedFrom` page, an add, delete or rename, or any path outside the allowlist all send the PR to a human. It runs on `pull_request_target` so a PR cannot edit its own gate, and approves with a GitHub App because `GITHUB_TOKEN` reviews do not count toward a required approval. Setup and the admin-only steps: [`.github/docs-publishing.md`](.github/docs-publishing.md).

A separate `Docs Drift` PR check (job name **Docs ship with code**, script `.github/scripts/check-docs-drift.sh`) fails when package runtime source changes without a *related* publishable docs signal: a mapped file under that package, a mapped `packages/sdk/docs/` page, a mapped root-level `docs/` guide whose `pkgs` array lists the package, the package `README.md`, or `packages/<pkg>/docs/` (non-sdk). JSDoc, unmirrored `packages/sdk/docs/` pages, `packages/skills`, an unrelated mapped file, and deleting a README or docs file do not count. Renaming source out of `src/` still counts as a source change, and every mapped `src` must be a `.md`/`.mdx` page that exists. A newly added `packages/sdk/docs/` page — including one moved in from elsewhere — must be on the map even on a docs-only PR, and renaming a mapped page must move its map entry with it; renaming an intentionally unmirrored page needs no entry. CI runs the check script from the PR base SHA when present so a PR cannot no-op the gate by editing it. Maintainers bypass the check with the `docs-not-needed` label. Nav entries in `docs/docs.json` are outside this gate.

`pnpm test:e2e` runs in its own CI job **on pull requests only**, never on push to `main` / `development`. The check is advisory: a live-mainnet failure or timeout is a warning annotation (the job stays green) because those tests hit live services and can fail on solver/relay/on-chain drift the PR did not cause. Setup/install/build failures in that job still fail the check. Run it locally when you touch a flow it covers.

A separate `AI Files Drift Check` workflow runs per pull request. Those deterministic gates prove AI files are structurally sound and that their code blocks compile; this one covers the prose they wrap. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to read its findings.

`pnpm check:sponsoring-contract` is a **manual** gate, deliberately outside CI: it diffs the SDK's hand-authored sponsoring wire types against the backend's OpenAPI document, and CI has no sponsoring service to fetch it from. Run it whenever the sponsoring contract moves on either side, and before a release. See [`packages/sdk/AGENTS.md`](packages/sdk/AGENTS.md) for how to obtain the spec without booting a signer.

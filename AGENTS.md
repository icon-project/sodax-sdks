# AGENTS.md

Repository navigation hub for coding agents. Keep this file slim: it is loaded for nearly every task. Read the package or app `AGENTS.md` that owns the files you will touch before making changes.

## Project Overview

SODAX is a cross-chain DeFi SDK monorepo built around a hub-and-spoke architecture with Sonic as the hub chain. The SDK surface covers swaps, lending/borrowing, staking, bridging, concentrated-liquidity DEX flows, token migration, partner fee operations, and recovery flows across EVM and non-EVM ecosystems.

Do not hardcode supported chain counts or chain lists in agent guidance. When exact support matters, inspect the source of truth in `@sodax/types`, package source, or generated docs.

### Docs site

`docs/` is the docs.sodax.com Mintlify site, built from this repo by Mintlify's GitHub App: a page merged here is published, and one pushed to a branch gets a preview URL on the PR. Read [`docs/AGENTS.md`](docs/AGENTS.md) before adding, moving or renaming a page — paths are URLs, and `docs.json` navigation is what makes a page reachable. Gates: `pnpm check:docs-nav` and `pnpm docs:validate`.

## Dependency Direction

- `@sodax/types` has no package dependencies.
- `@sodax/swaps-api` depends on `@sodax/types` (and `valibot`) — a standalone swaps-API wire client with no dependency on `@sodax/sdk`.
- `@sodax/sdk` depends on `@sodax/types` and `@sodax/swaps-api` (its `SwapsApiService` wraps the latter) and re-exports public shared types.
- `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core` depends on `@sodax/types`.
- `@sodax/wallet-sdk-react` depends on `@sodax/types` and `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core`.
- `@sodax/dapp-kit` depends on `@sodax/sdk` and imports wallet-provider contracts through SDK/type exports.
- `@sodax/skills` is markdown/package metadata only and must not depend on runtime SDK packages.

Respect these boundaries when adding imports. If a change seems to need a reverse dependency, stop and find the package-level pattern first.

## Common Commands

Use the package manager declared in `package.json`.

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm build:packages
pnpm build
pnpm lint
pnpm pretty
pnpm checkTs
pnpm test
pnpm check:ai
```

For a single package:

```bash
cd packages/<pkg> && pnpm test
cd packages/<pkg> && pnpm test:e2e
cd packages/<pkg> && pnpm coverage
cd packages/<pkg> && npx vitest run path/to/test.test.ts
```

To try unreleased `@sodax/*` packages in a project outside this repo, pack them into local
tarballs — plain `pnpm pack` is not enough, because it rewrites `workspace:*` to a registry
version. See [`docs/local-package-testing.md`](docs/local-package-testing.md).

```bash
pnpm pack:local --version 2.0.0-local.1 --packages @sodax/sdk
```

## Repo-Wide Rules

- Keep changes scoped to the requested task. Do not refactor, restyle, rename, or expand nearby code unless it is required for correctness.
- Read the nearest package/app `AGENTS.md` before editing under that subtree.
- SDK package sources use `.js` extensions in relative imports because dual ESM/CJS output resolves them at build time.
- Biome is the only formatter/linter. Do not add ESLint or Prettier config.
- Build order matters: packages build before apps.
- Commits must follow conventional commit format and must not include AI-tool attribution.
- Do not add exact chain counts, issue-era history, or current-state claims to agent guidance unless the statement is stable and source-of-truth-backed.

## Working Rules (planning + code quality)

These guide every change. Where a rule maps to tooling (types, lint, tests, `check:ai-*`), CI is the backstop; the rest are review-enforced. Before reporting a change done, run the relevant check and trust its real output over assumption.

- **Verify against current source.** Confirm every claim against `src/` before writing; do not rely on memory or older commits/PRs (the codebase refactors). If a fact is unverified, mark it so or ask.
- **Don't assume — ask when ambiguous.** If a required input or the scope is missing or unclear, stop and ask the requester or the source of truth rather than guessing.
- **Use the established skill/pattern.** Adding a token or chain → use the `add-token` / `add-chain` skill (`.claude/skills/`); don't wire it ad-hoc. Start from the nearest existing implementation.
- **Branch by case; don't over-generalize.** Chain/token work differs by family and feature (e.g. EVM vs non-EVM); verify the specific case instead of copying one onto another.
- **Source-derived config.** Token/chain config is source-of-truth in `@sodax/types` / backend — never hardcode chain or token lists in feature code.
- **No escape hatches.** Don't use `any`, `@ts-ignore`, non-null `!`, or unsafe casts to silence type/quality checks; fix the underlying type. (Existing `biome.json` overrides are tracked tech debt, not a license.)
- **Never commit or hardcode secrets.** Keep private keys, mnemonics, and RPC credentials in env vars (`process.env` / git-ignored `.env`, with `.env.example` placeholders) the way the `apps/node` smoke scripts do — never inline a real key, paste one into a sample, or log it. If a task needs a secret, stop and ask.
- **Fix the gate, don't game it.** Don't skip or disable tests (`.only`, `.skip`, deleted assertions), blanket-suppress lint, or bypass the husky pre-commit / commit-msg hooks (`--no-verify`, force-push) to go green. If a check fails, fix the cause or stop and report it — silencing it just hides the regression.
- **Preserve package boundaries.** Keep dependency direction intact and put reusable logic in the package/domain that owns it; don't hide cross-package coupling in callers.
- **Add dependencies deliberately.** Don't pull in a new runtime dependency for something the repo already covers; prefer existing utilities and the curated re-export subpaths in `packages/libs`. If a third-party dep is genuinely needed, isolate it through `packages/libs` and say why.
- **Keep feature services lean.** Feature-service code stays core feature logic; move reusable utilities and chain-specific work to `utils/`, entities, wallet providers, or spoke services. Extract a helper when it is genuinely shared, not as a speculative single-use abstraction.
- **Comment sparingly — why, not what.** Explain a non-obvious constraint or decision in a line or two; don't narrate what the code or config already says, and don't leave commented-out code.
- **Cover new code with meaningful tests.** Add or extend tests for core flows, invariants, edge cases, and chain/feature matrices beside the changed code; don't rely on superficial coverage.
- **Keep AI docs faithful.** When public behavior, imports, signatures, examples, chains, tokens, or feature support change, update `packages/skills` so agents can implement from code + docs without guessing; run `pnpm check:ai`.
- **Docs mirrored to GitBook keep absolute links.** `scripts/gitbook-sync-map.json` lists the READMEs and `packages/sdk/docs` pages that `sodax-document` mirrors to docs.sodax.com, moving and renaming them. In those files a link may stay relative only when the target is mirrored into the same destination directory under the same filename; every other target (moved doc, unmirrored doc, source file, directory) needs an absolute `https://github.com/icon-project/sodax-sdks/blob/main/…` URL, and never a `sodax-document` URL. Gate: `pnpm check:doc-links`.

**Definition of done:** scoped diff · behavior verified against `src/` · relevant `test`/`checkTs`/`lint`/`check:ai` green · `packages/skills` updated when public behavior changed · no unrelated refactor.

To review a change against these rules, use the `review-core-sdk` skill (`.claude/skills/review-core-sdk/`).

To author or validate changesets and govern a release (SemVer bumps, changelogs, `CONFIG_VERSION`), use the `release-governance` skill (`.claude/skills/release-governance/`).

## AI File Maintenance

- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical shared agent guidance. `CLAUDE.md` files should be thin Claude-specific shims that import the sibling `AGENTS.md`.
- Dev skills are authored and committed under `.claude/skills/` (the canonical copy). The `.agents/skills/` (Codex) and `.github/skills/` (Copilot) mirrors are gitignored and regenerated locally by the Vercel `skills` CLI (`npx skills`); native Codex/Copilot auto-trigger needs that local sync, while the `AGENTS.md` skill pointers work without it. Edit the skill in `.claude/skills/`, never a generated mirror.
- Root guidance is for information every domain needs. Put package/app-specific architecture, patterns, commands, and pitfalls in that subtree's `AGENTS.md`.
- Prefer broad durable patterns over volatile enumerations. When exact values matter, point agents to source files or package docs rather than copying values.
- Validate changes to these files with `pnpm check:ai-dev-files`.
- When a mirrored doc is added, renamed, or removed, update `scripts/gitbook-sync-map.json` and `sodax-document/sync-sodax-sdks.sh` together — that script is the upstream authority, and a stale mapping breaks the sync.

## CI Shape

GitHub Actions install dependencies with a frozen lockfile, lint, check circular dependencies, build packages, typecheck, validate dev AI files, validate AI consumer docs, validate mirrored doc links, build apps, run smoke checks, and run tests. When changing `packages/skills`, run `pnpm check:ai` locally; when changing a mirrored doc, run `pnpm check:doc-links`.

`pnpm test:e2e` runs in its own CI job **on push to `main` / `development` only**, never on pull requests: it hits live mainnet services, so it fails on state no PR controls (a solver that dropped an intent from memory, an unindexed relay tx, on-chain token/vault drift). Run it locally when you touch a flow it covers — a green PR does not mean the e2e suite passed.

`pnpm check:sponsoring-contract` is a **manual** gate, deliberately outside CI: it diffs the SDK's hand-authored sponsoring wire types against the backend's OpenAPI document, and CI has no sponsoring service to fetch it from. Run it whenever the sponsoring contract moves on either side, and before a release. See [`packages/sdk/AGENTS.md`](packages/sdk/AGENTS.md) for how to obtain the spec without booting a signer.

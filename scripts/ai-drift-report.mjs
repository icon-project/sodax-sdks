// reports is trusted on its word: every finding must carry a quote from the AI file and a quote
// from the source, and this script re-reads both files to confirm those quotes exist. A finding
// whose citation does not resolve is discarded — and listed as discarded, because a filter that
// hides its own work is just a different way of being wrong.
//
// Only a surviving contradiction fails the build, and only once `AI_DRIFT_ENFORCE` is set. Coverage
// gaps are reported as warnings: "does this doc mention the new thing enough" has no objective
// answer, and gating on it would train people to route around the check.
//
// Every exit path writes the report first. A check that goes red with nothing on the pull request
// to explain it is indistinguishable from a broken check, and reviewers learn to ignore both.

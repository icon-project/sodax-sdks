# Releasing SDK packages

Every publishable `@sodax/*` package shares one version, cut as a single `@sdks@<version>` git tag.
`pnpm release` bumps the versions; committing, tagging, and publishing stay human steps.

1. **Merge everything you are shipping into `main`.**

2. **Sync `release`, then merge `main` into it.** A stale `release` bumps from the wrong base and
   reuses the previous `CONFIG_VERSION`, so do not skip the fetch or the ff-only pull:

   ```bash
   git checkout release
   git fetch origin --tags
   git pull --ff-only origin release
   git pull --no-ff origin main
   ```

3. **Run `pnpm release`.** It prints the current version, the tag the notes are measured from, and
   the commits grouped by conventional-commit type, then prompts for the new version — `X.Y.Z`, or
   `X.Y.Z-rc.N` for a release candidate. Picking the number is your call; use the groups it just
   printed. An invalid or non-advancing version is refused and re-prompted. Pass it as an argument
   (`pnpm release 2.2.0`) to skip the prompt.

4. **It stops after mutating.** Every manifest is set to that version, `CONFIG_VERSION` is
   incremented once, and the gitignored `release-notes.md` is written. Nothing is committed or
   tagged for you. On failure it prints the two cleanup commands — `git checkout -- packages/` and
   `rm -f release-notes.md` — but does not run them: a partial mutation stays on disk until you do.

5. **Inspect the diff, then commit and push.** The command prints these with the version filled in:

   ```bash
   git add packages/
   git commit -m "chore: release @sdks@<version>"
   git push -u origin release
   ```

6. **Create the GitHub Release** — the tag is what triggers publishing:

   ```bash
   gh release create "@sdks@<version>" \
     --target release \
     --title "@sdks@<version>" \
     --notes-file release-notes.md \
     --prerelease # omit for a stable release
   ```

   [`sdks-publish.yml`](https://github.com/icon-project/sodax-sdks/blob/main/.github/workflows/sdks-publish.yml)
   validates every manifest against the tag, then publishes in dependency order. The dist-tag comes
   from the version: `X.Y.Z-rc.N` under `rc`, `X.Y.Z` under `latest`.

7. **Deprecate the new `@sodax/libs` version.** It ships for transitive installs only:

   ```bash
   npm deprecate @sodax/libs@<version> "Internal package — do not depend on directly. Consumed transitively by @sodax/sdk, @sodax/wallet-sdk-core, @sodax/wallet-sdk-react. Subpaths may be removed without notice when upstream Turbopack bugs are fixed."
   ```

8. **Announce** the npm links and notes in
   [Venture 23 #sodax-sdk](https://discord.com/channels/688963201101987847/1385504703672094760) and
   [Sodax #sodax_sdk](https://discord.com/channels/880651922682560582/1425075360550223994).

**If publishing fails after a version reached npm, cut a new version.** npm never allows
republishing the same package version.

## What `pnpm release` refuses to do

It stops before changing anything if:

- you are not on `release`, or the working tree is dirty
- `origin/main` or `origin/release` is stale, or `main` is not fully merged into `release`
- your `release` is missing `origin/release` or the newest `@sdks@` tag
- the version was already published by an `@sodax/<pkg>@<version>` backport tag
- the package lists in `scripts/bump-versions.sh` and `sdks-publish.yml` have drifted from
  `packages/` — this is what stops a new package being versioned but never published, or the reverse

`scripts/bump-versions.sh` is the only thing that edits versions. Never hand-edit a package
`version` or `CONFIG_VERSION`.

## Republishing a single package

The per-package `sodax-<pkg>-publish.yml` workflows publish one package, and are the way to ship a
backport since the unified flow only moves forward. Push the tag `@sodax/<pkg>@<version>`. Prefer
the unified `@sdks@*` flow for normal releases so packages stay version-aligned.

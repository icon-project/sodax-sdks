# Sponsoring — `SponsoringService`

Stellar account activation paid for by the SODAX sponsor account. Reached on the `Sodax` facade as
`sodax.sponsoring`.

A brand-new SODAX user holds 0 XLM, and a Stellar account must exist on-chain before it can hold or
receive anything — including a trustline. This service drives the sponsored-reserve flow that fixes
that: the sponsor pays the account's base reserve, and the user pays nothing.

The user's wallet still has to sign. Stellar's sponsorship sandwich requires the *sponsored* account
to authorise `endSponsoringFutureReserves`, and only the user's wallet holds that key — so the client
builds and signs, and the backend validates, co-signs as the sponsor, and submits. The sponsor's
signature is added server-side; never attempt it client-side.

## What activation does and does not unlock

Read this before building a flow on top of activation — the boundary is easy to get wrong, and the
mistake is only visible at the point a user's transaction fails.

Activation makes the account able to **receive**. It does not make it able to **send**. The sponsor
covers the account's own base reserve, and `startingBalance` is `0` by contract, so a freshly activated
account holds **zero spendable XLM** — the reserve is locked on the *sponsor's* balance, not sitting in
the user's account. With no XLM it cannot pay a transaction fee, and it cannot cover the extra base
reserve a new subentry locks. So it cannot establish its own first trustline.

The way out is native XLM, which needs no trustline:

1. **Activate** — free to the user. The account now exists and can receive.
2. **Receive XLM** — no trustline, no fee on the recipient's side. This is what makes the account
   able to act.
3. **Add trustlines** for other assets — now affordable, since the account holds XLM.

So a destination token that is *not* native XLM has two prerequisites, not one. `@sodax/dapp-kit`'s
`useStellarGate` sequences all three states for you; prefer it over calling
`isStellarAccountActive` and a trustline check side by side. `getStellarAccountStatus` is the
underlying read — it reports `canAffordTrustline`, which is `false` for exactly this
freshly-activated case.

Note that affordability is measured against `availableBalanceStroops`, not the total balance. Stellar
locks one base reserve per subentry, so an account holding 0.6 XLM with one existing trustline has only
0.1 XLM spendable and cannot afford a second — the total would say otherwise.

The base reserve itself is a network setting validators can vote to change, not a protocol constant, so
the SDK reads it from the latest Horizon ledger (cached for an hour) instead of assuming 0.5 XLM.
`status.trustlineMinXlmStroops` is that live requirement — render it rather than the exported
`STELLAR_TRUSTLINE_MIN_XLM_STROOPS`, which is only the value assumed when the ledger read fails.

Sponsored trustlines and fee sponsorship would remove step 2; neither exists yet.

> See also [`STELLAR_TRUSTLINE.md`](STELLAR_TRUSTLINE.md) for the trustline step itself.

## Methods

```ts
sodax.sponsoring.activateStellarAccount(params: ActivateStellarAccountParams)
  : Promise<Result<ActivateStellarAccountResult, SponsoringOrchestrationError>>

sodax.sponsoring.isStellarAccountActive(params: { address: string })
  : Promise<Result<boolean, SponsoringLookupError>>

sodax.sponsoring.getStellarAccountStatus(params: { address: string })
  : Promise<Result<StellarAccountStatus, SponsoringLookupError>>
  // { exists, nativeBalanceStroops, availableBalanceStroops, canAffordTrustline, trustlineMinXlmStroops }
  // One Horizon account read, plus an hourly read of the network's base reserve.

sodax.sponsoring.getStellarSponsorConfig(params?: { forceRefresh?: boolean; requestConfig?: RequestOverrideConfig })
  : Promise<Result<StellarSponsorConfig, SponsoringConfigError>>
```

Every method returns `Result<T>` and never throws. The raw HTTP endpoints remain available as
`sodax.api.sponsoring` (see [`BACKEND_API.md`](BACKEND_API.md)) — use `sodax.sponsoring` unless you
need the uncached wire surface, because the orchestrator owns the sponsor-config cache, the Horizon
reads, and the retry policy.

## Activating an account

```ts
import { ChainKeys } from '@sodax/sdk';

const result = await sodax.sponsoring.activateStellarAccount({
  address: stellarAddress,
  walletProvider: stellarWalletProvider,
  onSignatureRequired: ({ attempt, reason }) => {
    setPrompt(reason === 'sequenceConflict'
      ? 'Your first signature went stale — please sign again.'
      : 'Approve the activation in your wallet.');
  },
});

if (!result.ok) {
  // See "Handling failures" below — branch on result.error.context.nextAction.
  return;
}

if (result.value.status === 'alreadyActive') {
  // Success. The account already existed on-chain, so nothing was submitted.
} else {
  console.log('activated in tx', result.value.hash);
}
```

### `alreadyActive` is a success

This is the single easiest thing to get wrong. `activateStellarAccount` has two success shapes:

| `status` | `hash` | `attempts` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `'submitted'` | the tx hash | `1` or `2` | A sponsored-create was submitted and landed. |
| `'alreadyActive'` | `null` | `0`, `1` or `2` | The account already existed. **Nothing was submitted, and this is still a success** — the account is usable. |

`attempts: 0` means the client-side pre-flight caught it and the user was never prompted at all. A
non-zero value means the server reported it (either from its own pre-flight or from an
`op_already_exists` race), so the prompt had already been paid for.

Because the result type is a discriminated union on `status`, `if (result.value.status === 'submitted')`
narrows `hash` to `string` with no non-null assertion.

### The second signature

A sponsor has one sequence number, and every integrator's activation moves it. When it moves under an
in-flight activation the server returns `409`, and the only fix is to rebuild from a fresh sequence
and **sign again**. `activateStellarAccount` does that automatically once (`allowSequenceRetry`,
default `true`).

That second prompt is a UX event, not an implementation detail: a wallet extension steals focus the
moment it opens, so the explanation has to already be on screen. Wire `onSignatureRequired` — it fires
immediately *before* each prompt with `{ attempt: 1 | 2, reason: 'initial' | 'sequenceConflict' }`.

Set `allowSequenceRetry: false` for headless callers with no interactive signer, or to own the backoff
yourself. The retry is exactly one attempt, never a loop.

A transient upstream failure (`503 HORIZON_UNAVAILABLE`) is different: the signed envelope stays valid
until its `maxTime` and its sequence can be consumed only once, so the *identical bytes* are
re-submitted with no new prompt. `maxHorizonRetries` (default `2`, `0` disables) bounds that.

## Handling failures

Branch on `error.context.nextAction`, never on `error.message`. The HTTP status alone is not enough —
the two `503` variants want opposite responses.

| `nextAction` | `retryable` | `requiresNewSignature` | Typical cause | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fixIntegration` | ✗ | ✗ | `400 INVALID_SPONSOR_XDR`, or a rejected body shape | An SDK/caller bug. Never retry as-is. |
| `checkApiKey` | ✗ | ✗ | `401` — missing or unknown `x-api-key` | Deployment problem; fail fast. |
| `rebuildAndResign` | ✓ | ✓ | `409 SPONSOR_SEQUENCE_CONFLICT` | Rebuild from a fresh sequence. Costs a new signature — handled for you unless `allowSequenceRetry: false`. |
| `retrySameRequest` | ✓ | ✗ | `503 HORIZON_UNAVAILABLE` | Re-submit the identical payload. No new signature. |
| `backoff` | ✓ | ✗ | `429` (either flavour), a draining coordinator, or any transport failure/timeout | Wait, then retry. Honour `retryAfterSeconds` when present. |
| `contactOperator` | ✗ | ✗ | `503 SPONSOR_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`, `500` | The sponsor needs a top-up, or the server faulted. Not fixable by retrying soon. |
| `abort` | ✗ | ✗ | `422 SPONSOR_TRANSACTION_REJECTED` | Deterministic on-chain rejection. Terminal. |

The classification is also available directly via `classifySponsorError(error)` if you are calling
`sodax.api.sponsoring` yourself:

```ts
import { classifySponsorError } from '@sodax/sdk';

const submitted = await sodax.api.sponsoring.createStellarSponsoredAccount({ data: signedXdr });
if (!submitted.ok) {
  const { action, retryable, retryAfterSeconds } = classifySponsorError(submitted.error);
}
```

Useful `error.context` fields on an activation failure: `nextAction`, `retryable`,
`requiresNewSignature`, `status` (HTTP status, absent for transport failures), `code` (one of the
seven `SponsoringApiErrorCode`s, present only when the body carried a recognised code),
`retryAfterSeconds`, `sponsorSequence`, `sponsorAccount`, and `attempts`.

Note that a body's `error` field is **not** always a domain code — framework exceptions put a human
label there (`'Unauthorized'`, `'Bad Request'`), and two paths omit it entirely: the per-IP
throttler's `429`, and the server's fallback for an unexpected error (a bare `500`).
That is why `SPONSORING_API_ERROR_CODES` ships as a runtime array: membership-test before treating
`error` as a code. `classifySponsorError` already does this.

## Checking whether an account is active

```ts
const active = await sodax.sponsoring.isStellarAccountActive({ address });
if (!active.ok) {
  // A Horizon read failure — do NOT render this as "not active".
} else if (!active.value) {
  showActivateButton();
}
```

This surfaces a read failure as an error rather than reporting `false`, on purpose: rendering a
transient Horizon blip as "your account is not active" is the failure mode worth avoiding when the
answer drives UI.

The pre-flight *inside* `activateStellarAccount` does the opposite and degrades to "assume not
active" on a read failure. There it is purely an optimisation — it saves a doomed wallet prompt — so a
blip must not fail an activation that would otherwise succeed. The server runs its own pre-flight and
converts a post-submit `op_already_exists` into `alreadyActive: true`, so the outcome stays correct
either way; the only cost is one wasted prompt.

## Sponsor config

`getStellarSponsorConfig()` returns the service's published build parameters — `sponsorAccount`,
`networkPassphrase`, the fee band, `maxTimeboundSeconds`, `requiredStartingBalance`. The activation
flow fetches it itself; call it directly only to display which sponsor account is funding an
activation.

**Never hardcode the sponsor account.** Reading it from the service is precisely what makes a sponsor
rotation a config change instead of a coordinated client release. The values are served from the same
constants the server-side validator enforces, so what is published and what is accepted cannot drift.

The result is cached for `SPONSOR_CONFIG_TTL_MS` (60s, mirroring the server's
`Cache-Control: private, max-age=60`), keyed by effective base URL, with concurrent callers sharing
one in-flight request. Failures are never cached. Pass `forceRefresh: true` to bypass it.

## Configuration

The sponsoring service runs on its own host, so it gets its own `ApiConfig` slice and its own api key:

```ts
const sodax = new Sodax({
  api: {
    sponsoringApiConfig: {
      baseURL: 'https://api.sodax.com/v1',   // base URL incl. any version prefix — the SDK appends /sponsorships/stellar
      apiKey: process.env.SODAX_SPONSORING_API_KEY,
    },
  },
});
```

`apiKey` is sugar for the `x-api-key` header the service gates on; an explicit `x-api-key` in
`headers` wins, so you can proxy through your own backend instead. Keep the key in an env var — never
inline it.

The instance-wide `new Sodax({ apiKey })` is **gated** for this service: it is inherited only when the
call actually targets a SODAX gateway — the packaged sponsoring default or the resolved shared root —
and that check is made per request against the effective target, so a per-call `baseURL` override
cannot carry it off-gateway. A custom sponsoring origin never receives it. The slice key above is the
credential for independently hosted sponsoring and wins wherever the slice points.

Two deliberate differences from `swapsApiConfig`:

- **`baseURL` does not inherit from `baseApiConfig`.** Every service resolves the same gateway root by
  default, sponsoring included — but it reaches that default independently rather than by inheritance,
  so pointing the base API at a private proxy or a staging host never silently drags the sponsoring
  calls along with it. Only an explicit `sponsoringApiConfig.baseURL` (or
  `DEFAULT_SPONSORING_API_ENDPOINT`) is used.
- **Headers do not inherit either.** Forwarding a consumer's `Authorization` — scoped to their own
  backend — to a different host would be a credential leak. Put a cross-cutting sponsoring header on
  `sponsoringApiConfig.headers`, or pass it per call.

`baseURL` is the service base URL **including any version or gateway prefix** — the SDK appends only
`SPONSORING_API_STELLAR_BASE_PATH` (`/sponsorships/stellar`), because where the service is mounted is
the deployment's business. This is the same rule every backend service now follows; see
[CONFIGURE_SDK.md](https://github.com/icon-project/sodax-sdks/blob/main/packages/sdk/docs/CONFIGURE_SDK.md)
for the shared URL model. The packaged default is `https://api.sodax.com/v1`; point `baseURL` at
`http://localhost:3011` to run against a local `sponsoring-api`, which serves the routes at the bare
origin.

## React

`@sodax/dapp-kit` wraps all three methods:

```tsx
import { useActivateStellarAccount, useSponsorConfig, useStellarAccountActive } from '@sodax/dapp-kit';
```

| Hook | Kind | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `useStellarAccountActive` | query | `['sponsoring', 'stellarAccountActive', address]` |
| `useStellarAccountStatus` | query | `['sponsoring', 'stellarAccountStatus', address]`; the richer sibling — exists plus balances plus `canAffordTrustline` from one Horizon read. Prefer it whenever the next step involves a non-native token |
| `useSponsorConfig` | query | `['sponsoring', 'sponsorConfig']`, `staleTime: SPONSOR_CONFIG_TTL_MS` |
| `useActivateStellarAccount` | mutation | `['sponsoring', 'activateStellarAccount']`; on success invalidates the active-check and the Stellar balance query |

`apps/stellar-sponsor-example` is a runnable reference app for the whole flow. Its Test lab view
bundles a zero-dependency mock backend, so every failure class in the table above can be exercised
offline without a sponsoring service and without spending XLM.

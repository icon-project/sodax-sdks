/**
 * Sizing a leverage position's swap leg.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT IS NOT OPTIONAL. A position's leverage is bought through the solver, and
 * the two legs do not trade at their oracle ratio. `LeverageHook` supplies whatever the solver
 * actually paid and only *then* borrows against it, so the pool's health check at fill time sees
 * `deposit + solver output`, never `deposit x leverage`. Size the leg from oracle prices and the
 * borrow reverts with Aave error `'36'` (COLLATERAL_CANNOT_COVER_NEW_BORROW) — the intent is accepted,
 * the solver fills, and the whole fill unwinds. That is not a hypothetical, it happened twice on
 * mainnet, and the two failures had different causes worth keeping apart:
 *
 *   - counting a debt-side deposit as collateral as well as handing it to the solver, which put an
 *     11.03x open at a projected 84% LTV;
 *   - pricing the solver's output at oracle parity, which put the same open at 90.9% when the real
 *     figure was 92.06% against a 91% cap.
 *
 * `side` addresses the first and `f` the second.
 *
 * So sizing is a two-phase thing, and both phases are here:
 *
 *   1. {@link sizeLeverageBorrow} — how much to borrow for a target leverage. Oracle-priced, because
 *      there is nothing else to go on yet. Quote THIS amount.
 *   2. {@link projectLeverageLeg} — given that quote, the slippage floor, what the position really
 *      looks like at that floor, and the highest leverage the quote actually supports.
 *
 * Everything in phase 2 is projected from the FLOOR rather than the quote, deliberately: the floor is
 * the worst fill the intent permits, so if the floor is safe every fill is. Projecting from the quote
 * leaves the slippage tolerance as unmodelled headroom, which is exactly the gap that failed.
 *
 * Prices are the pool oracle's, in its base currency; any consistent unit works since only ratios
 * matter. Rates and LTVs are fractions, not percentages.

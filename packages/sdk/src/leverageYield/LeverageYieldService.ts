 * - `deposit` / `withdraw` — build a {@link LeverageYieldSwapPayload} for a swap-style deposit

 * - `createVaultIntent` / `vaultSwap` / `notifySolver` — leverage-yield copies of the swap
 *   domain's `createIntent` / `swap()` / `postExecution` (duplicated deliberately — the vault
 *   execution modifiers `hubWalletSwap` and per-intent `partnerFee` live here, not on the swap
 *   domain). `createVaultIntent` submits the intent tx on the source spoke chain; `vaultSwap`
 *   orchestrates the full create → verify → relay → notify-solver lifecycle; `notifySolver` is
 *   the standalone notify step, public so callers driving the relay themselves (after a
 *   `createVaultIntent`) can complete the flow.
 * - `approve` / `isAllowanceValid` — Sonic-direct allowance management for the vault's
 *   underlying asset (sodaWEETH-style).
 * - `getPosition` / `getApr` / `getEffectiveApr` / `getLsdApr` / `getMaxWithdraw` /
 *   `getMaxWithdrawForUser` / `getShareBalance` / `getShareBalanceForUser` /
 *   `getTotalAssets` / `previewDeposit` / `previewWithdraw` / `previewRedeem` — reads.
 *   Use `getEffectiveApr` for the honest LSD-aware APR; `getApr` reports the AAVE-only
 *   spread and goes negative when the LSD's native staking yield is the alpha source.
 * - `listVaults` / `getVault` / `getVaultByAddress` — registry lookups.

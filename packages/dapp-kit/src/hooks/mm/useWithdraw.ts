/**
 * Hook for performing withdrawals from the Sodax money market.
 *
 * This hook exposes a mutation that executes the complete withdrawal logic, including transaction
 * creation and handling cross-chain communication. It leverages React Query's mutation API for
 * easy asynchronous handling and status tracking within UI components.
 *
 * @returns {UseMutationResult<WithdrawResponse, MoneyMarketError<'CREATE_WITHDRAW_INTENT_FAILED' | 'WITHDRAW_UNKNOWN_ERROR' | RelayErrorCode>, UseWithdrawParams>}
 *   Mutation result object, with:
 *   - mutateAsync: (params: UseWithdrawParams) => Promise<WithdrawResponse>
 *       Initiates the withdrawal using the provided params.
 *   - isPending: boolean indicating if a transaction is in progress.
 *   - error: MoneyMarketError if an error occurred while withdrawing, otherwise undefined.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const { mutateAsync: withdraw, isPending, error } = useWithdraw();
 * await withdraw({ params: withdrawParams, spokeProvider });
 * ```
 *
 * @throws {Error} When:
 *   - spokeProvider is not provided or invalid.
 *   - Underlying withdrawal logic fails.

/**
 * Hook for withdrawing supplied tokens from the Sodax money market.
 *
 * This hook provides functionality to withdraw previously supplied tokens from the money market protocol,
 * handling the entire withdrawal process including transaction creation, submission,
 * and cross-chain communication.
 *
 * @param {XToken} spokeToken - The token to withdraw from the spoke chain. Must be an XToken with valid address and chain information.
 * @param {SpokeProvider} spokeProvider - The spoke provider to use for the withdraw transaction. Must be a valid SpokeProvider instance.
 *
 * @returns {UseMutationResult<WithdrawResponse, Error, string>} A mutation result object with the following properties:
 *   - mutateAsync: Function to execute the withdraw transaction
 *   - isPending: Boolean indicating if a transaction is in progress
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const { mutateAsync: withdraw, isPending, error } = useWithdraw(spokeToken);
 * await withdraw('100');
 * ```
 *
 * @throws {Error} When:
 *   - spokeProvider is not available
 *   - Transaction execution fails

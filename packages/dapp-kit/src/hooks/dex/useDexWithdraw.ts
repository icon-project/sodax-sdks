/**
 * React hook to provide a mutation for withdrawing assets from a DEX pool.
 *
 * This hook returns a mutation result object valid for use with React Query.
 * The mutation function expects an object with the withdrawal parameters and a SpokeProvider,
 * and triggers the withdrawal operation on the DEX. On success, it invalidates the relevant
 * ['dex', 'poolBalances'] query to fetch the updated balances.
 *
 * @returns {UseMutationResult<[SpokeTxHash, HubTxHash], Error, UseDexWithdrawParams>}
 *   Mutation result object. Use its properties to:
 *   - Call `mutateAsync({ params, spokeProvider })` to perform the withdrawal.
 *   - Track progress with `isPending`.
 *   - Access any `error` encountered during the mutation.
 *
 * @example
 * const { mutateAsync: withdraw, isPending, error } = useDexWithdraw();
 * await withdraw({ params, spokeProvider });

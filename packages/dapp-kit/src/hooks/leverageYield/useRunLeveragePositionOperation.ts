 * Runs position calls that DO NOT post an intent — `withdraw`, `settle` and `cancel` — as the owning
 * hub wallet. They are synchronous on the hub, so resolving means the work is done.
 *
 * Still routed, never sent directly: the position's `onlyOwner` is the hub wallet, so a call sent
 * from the signer reverts `NotOwner`. Locally through the wallet router on the hub, relayed from
 * anywhere else.
 *
 * USE {@link useSubmitLeveragePositionIntent} FOR `increaseLeverage` AND `decreaseLeverage`. Those
 * only post a request a solver fills later, and this hook does not notify the solver, so sending one
 * through here creates an intent nothing will fill. It expires silently and the operation is lost.
 * The other direction is harmless by comparison: notifying about a withdraw is noise, not damage.
 *
 * Balances are invalidated for `srcChainKey` because a withdraw pays out.
 *
 * @experimental OFF-HUB (SPOKE) ORIGINS ARE UNVERIFIED ON-CHAIN, and this is the hook that carries the
 *              worst of it: an exit or cancellation delivering the underlying back to the spoke it
 *              came from has never run on mainnet. Bitcoin is refused outright.

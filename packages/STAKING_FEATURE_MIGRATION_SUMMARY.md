# SODAX Staking Feature: v1 → v2 Migration Playbook

## TL;DR

The v2 staking hooks adopt the **canonical pure-mutation pattern** from `useSwap` /
`useSupply` / `useDexDeposit`: no hook-time arguments, all inputs (`params`,
`walletProvider`) passed via mutation vars, and `data` is the SDK `Result<T>` returned
**as-is** — branch on `data?.ok`. **Staking is fully cross-chain** — every action mutation
returns `Result<[SpokeTxHash, HubTxHash]>` (matches dex/bridge, not MM-style approve). The
underlying SDK methods accept `srcChainKey: K extends SpokeChainKey` + `srcAddress` and
relay spoke→hub via `relayTxAndWaitPacket` automatically.

The seven mechanical things you need to do:

1. Replace `useSpokeProvider(chainKey, walletProvider)` and the `spokeProvider: SpokeProvider`
   field on every params object with the wallet provider directly. Mutation hooks are now
   zero-arg; pass `{ params, walletProvider }` to `mutateAsync`.
2. Add `srcChainKey` + `srcAddress` to every `StakeParams` / `UnstakeParams` /
   `InstantUnstakeParams` / `ClaimParams` / `CancelUnstakeParams` you build. Every action
   params type now requires both fields.
3. The 3 approve hooks (`useStakeApprove` / `useUnstakeApprove` / `useInstantUnstakeApprove`)
   and 3 allowance hooks (`useStakeAllowance` / `useUnstakeAllowance` /
   `useInstantUnstakeAllowance`) **share one underlying SDK method each**
   (`staking.approve` / `staking.isAllowanceValid`) discriminated by `params.action`. Each
   hook injects the `action` literal internally — callers pass `Omit<…Params, 'action'>`.
4. Drop `StakingError<Code>` from mutation generics; type errors as plain `Error`. The CODE
   moved from `error.code` to `error.message`.
5. Allowance hooks pass `raw: true` to `staking.isAllowanceValid` so no `walletProvider`
   is needed (the underlying read does not consult `walletProvider`). Same trick as
   `useDexAllowance`.
6. Info hooks rename `(spokeProvider)` arg → `{ srcAddress, srcChainKey, queryOptions? }`
   typed input. The 3 cross-chain info hooks (`useStakingInfo`, `useUnstakingInfo`,
   `useUnstakingInfoWithPenalty`) all call `getStakingInfoFromSpoke` /
   `getUnstakingInfo` / `getUnstakingInfoWithPenalty` with `(srcAddress, srcChainKey)`
   and derive the hub wallet internally. Hub-only hooks (`useStakingConfig`,
   `useStakeRatio`, `useInstantUnstakeRatio`, `useConvertedAssets`) take `amount` only
   (or no input).
7. Demo's `useSodaBalance` helper becomes a thin wrapper around `useXBalances`. Drop the
   `spokeProvider` arg; pass `(chainKey, userAddress)`. The hook looks up the SODA token
   via `sodax.config.findSupportedTokenBySymbol(chainKey, 'SODA')`.

## Staking-specific divergences from swap / MM / dex

Trip-wires that catch staking migrators specifically:

1. **Action-discriminator inside one SDK method.** Unlike dex (`assetService.approve` is
   per-deposit) or MM (`moneyMarket.approve` is action-discriminated but exposed via a
   single dapp-kit hook `useMMApprove`), staking exposes `staking.approve` as a single
   action-discriminated method **but** dapp-kit splits it into 3 hooks for v1 ergonomic parity
   (`useStakeApprove`, `useUnstakeApprove`, `useInstantUnstakeApprove`). Each hook injects
   the `action` literal internally; callers don't pass `action` in vars. Same split for the
   3 allowance hooks. **This was a deliberate choice** to keep v1 demo call-sites readable —
   if you're building a fresh consumer, calling `sodax.staking.approve({ params, raw: false,
   walletProvider })` directly with the right `action` is also fine.

2. **All 5 staking actions are cross-chain.** Even though staking writes happen on the hub
   (Sonic), the SDK's `stake` / `unstake` / `instantUnstake` / `claim` / `cancelUnstake`
   methods all accept `srcChainKey: K extends SpokeChainKey` and relay spoke→hub via
   `relayTxAndWaitPacket` when `srcChainKey !== hub`. **Return type is always
   `Result<[SpokeTxHash, HubTxHash]>`** — same as dex/bridge, never MM-style
   `Result<TxReturnType<K, false>>`. Do not treat staking as hub-only.

3. **`staking.approve` returns `Result<TxReturnType<K, false>>`, not a tx-pair.** Approve is
   spoke-only (no relay) — it just spends ERC-20 allowance on the source chain. So the 3
   approve hooks return `Result<TxReturnType<K, false>>` (a single tx hash), unlike the 5
   action mutations that return `Result<[SpokeTxHash, HubTxHash]>`.

4. **Info getter signatures changed.** v1 hooks took a single `spokeProvider` arg; v2 takes
   typed `{ srcAddress, srcChainKey }`. The SDK derives the hub wallet from those internally
   via `HubService.getUserHubWalletAddress`. `useStakingInfo` calls
   `getStakingInfoFromSpoke` (not `getStakingInfo`, which takes a hub-already address).

5. **Hub-only / amount-only query hooks have no chain context.** `useStakingConfig` (no
   args), `useStakeRatio({ amount })`, `useInstantUnstakeRatio({ amount })`,
   `useConvertedAssets({ amount })` — none of these accept `srcChainKey` or
   `spokeProvider`. The vault state and penalty parameters live entirely on the hub.

6. **No raw-tx variants exposed in dapp-kit.** The SDK has `createStakeIntent` /
   `createUnstakeIntent` / etc. (`Raw extends boolean`), but those are spoke-only (no
   relay) and not surfaced through dapp-kit. Only worth wiring when product needs
   sign-elsewhere flows.

## Type / Symbol Rename Cheat Sheet

### Field-level renames

| Type | Old shape | New shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `StakeParams<K>` | `{ amount, account, minReceive, action: 'stake' }` | `{ srcChainKey, srcAddress, amount, minReceive, action: 'stake' }` | Generic `K` carries the literal chain key. `account` field renamed to `srcAddress`. |
| `UnstakeParams<K>` | `{ amount, account, action: 'unstake' }` | `{ srcChainKey, srcAddress, amount, action: 'unstake' }` | Same rename. |
| `InstantUnstakeParams<K>` | `{ amount, minAmount, account, action: 'instantUnstake' }` | `{ srcChainKey, srcAddress, amount, minAmount, action: 'instantUnstake' }` | Same. |
| `ClaimParams<K>` | `{ requestId, amount, action: 'claim' }` | `{ srcChainKey, srcAddress, requestId, amount, action: 'claim' }` | Adds chain context. |
| `CancelUnstakeParams<K>` | `{ requestId, action: 'cancelUnstake' }` | `{ srcChainKey, srcAddress, requestId, action: 'cancelUnstake' }` | Adds chain context. |
| `useStakingInfo` props | `(spokeProvider)` arg | `{ srcAddress, srcChainKey, queryOptions? }` | v1 took a single positional arg; v2 takes a typed object. |
| `useUnstakingInfo` / `useUnstakingInfoWithPenalty` props | `(userAddress, spokeProvider)` | `{ srcAddress, srcChainKey, queryOptions? }` | v1 ignored `userAddress` and used `spokeProvider` internally; v2 reads `srcAddress` directly. |
| `useStakeApprove` etc. mutation vars | `{ params: <Params with action> }` (and hook took `spokeProvider`) | `{ params: Omit<<Params>, 'action'>, walletProvider }` | Hook is zero-arg; `action` injected internally. |
| `useStake` etc. mutation vars | `{ params: <Params> }` (and hook took `spokeProvider`) | `Omit<<Action>Action<K, false>, 'raw'>` (i.e. `{ params, walletProvider, skipSimulation?, timeout? }`) | Includes the `action` literal in `params`; hook does not inject it. |

### Deleted symbols (replace, don't shim)

- `useSpokeProvider` — gone from `@sodax/dapp-kit`. Pass `(chainKey, walletProvider)` directly
  via mutation vars. `useWalletProvider(chainKey)` from `@sodax/wallet-sdk-react` returns the
  right type.
- `SpokeProvider` union and every `*SpokeProvider` class — gone. Demo's v1 `useSodaBalance`
  reached into `EvmSpokeProvider`/`SonicSpokeProvider` via `instanceof` checks; v2
  rewrites the helper around `useXBalances` from dapp-kit.
- `StakingError<Code>` and the rest of the module-error type-guard family — branch on
  `error.message` (e.g. `'STAKE_FAILED'`, `'UNSTAKE_FAILED'`) and/or `error.cause`. SDK
  CLAUDE.md "Error message convention" has the canonical taxonomy.
- v1 instance-method check `spokeProvider instanceof SonicSpokeProvider` — replace with
  `isHubChainKeyType(chainKey)` (from `@sodax/types`) where needed.

### New v2 types worth knowing about

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `StakeAction<K, Raw>` / `UnstakeAction<K, Raw>` / `InstantUnstakeAction<K, Raw>` / `ClaimAction<K, Raw>` / `CancelUnstakeAction<K, Raw>` | `SpokeExecActionParams<K, Raw, *Params<K>>` — the discriminated union shape that pairs `raw` with `walletProvider`. |
| `StakingParamsUnion<K, Raw>` | Union of all 5 action params; consumed by `staking.approve` / `staking.isAllowanceValid`. |
| `UnstakeRequestWithPenalty` | `UserUnstakeInfo & { penalty, penaltyPercentage, claimableAmount }` returned by `getUnstakingInfoWithPenalty`. |

## The Pure-Mutation Pattern (Staking edition)

### v1 (before)

```tsx
const walletProvider = useWalletProvider(selectedChainId);
const spokeProvider = useSpokeProvider(selectedChainId, walletProvider);

const { mutateAsync: stake } = useStake(spokeProvider);
const { mutateAsync: approveStake } = useStakeApprove(spokeProvider);
const { data: isStakeAllowed } = useStakeAllowance(
  { amount, account: account.address as `0x\${string}`, minReceive },
  spokeProvider,
);

await stake({ amount, account: account.address as `0x\${string}`, minReceive, action: 'stake' });  // throws on !ok
```

### v2 (after)

```tsx
const walletProvider = useWalletProvider(selectedChainId);
const srcAddress = account?.address as `0x\${string}` | undefined;

const { mutateAsync: stake } = useStake();
const { mutateAsync: approveStake } = useStakeApprove();
const { data: isStakeAllowed } = useStakeAllowance({
  params: srcAddress ? { srcChainKey: selectedChainId, srcAddress, amount, minReceive } : undefined,
});

const result = await stake({
  params: { srcChainKey: selectedChainId, srcAddress, amount, minReceive, action: 'stake' },
  walletProvider,
});
if (result.ok) {
  const [spokeTxHash, hubTxHash] = result.value;
  // …
}
```

The cast-at-boundary pattern from the swap migration applies as needed — but typically a
single `const srcAddress = xAccount?.address as \\`0x\\\${string}\\` | undefined` extracted at
component scope is enough.

## Dapp-kit Hook API Contract (v2)

Link to source rather than transcribe so this doc doesn't drift:

- `packages/dapp-kit/src/hooks/staking/useStake.ts` — generic `<K>`, mutation input
  `Omit<StakeAction<K, false>, 'raw'>`, returns `Result<[SpokeTxHash, HubTxHash]>`. Same
  shape for `useUnstake`, `useInstantUnstake`, `useClaim`, `useCancelUnstake`.
- `packages/dapp-kit/src/hooks/staking/useStakeApprove.ts` — generic `<K>`, mutation vars
  `{ params: Omit<StakeParams<K>, 'action'>, walletProvider }`, returns
  `Result<TxReturnType<K, false>>`. Hook injects `action: 'stake'` internally. Same shape
  for `useUnstakeApprove` (`'unstake'`) and `useInstantUnstakeApprove` (`'instantUnstake'`).
- `packages/dapp-kit/src/hooks/staking/useStakeAllowance.ts` — generic `<K>`, query input
  `{ params: Omit<StakeParams<K>, 'action'> | undefined, queryOptions? }`. Calls
  `isAllowanceValid({ params, raw: true })` internally. 5s `refetchInterval`,
  `gcTime: 0`. Same shape for `useUnstakeAllowance` and `useInstantUnstakeAllowance`.
- `packages/dapp-kit/src/hooks/staking/useStakingInfo.ts` /
  `useUnstakingInfo.ts` / `useUnstakingInfoWithPenalty.ts` — query input
  `{ srcAddress, srcChainKey, queryOptions? }`. 5s `refetchInterval`. Throws on `!ok`.
- `packages/dapp-kit/src/hooks/staking/useStakingConfig.ts` — no args, query, 30s
  `refetchInterval`. Throws on `!ok`.
- `packages/dapp-kit/src/hooks/staking/useStakeRatio.ts` /
  `useInstantUnstakeRatio.ts` / `useConvertedAssets.ts` — query input `{ amount, queryOptions? }`.
  10s `refetchInterval`. `enabled: amount !== undefined`.

## Worked Example: full `StakingPage` migration

**Before (v1):**

```tsx
const walletProvider = useWalletProvider(selectedChainId);
const spokeProvider = useSpokeProvider(selectedChainId, walletProvider);

const { mutateAsync: stake } = useStake(spokeProvider);
const { mutateAsync: approveStake } = useStakeApprove(spokeProvider);
const { data: isStakeAllowed } = useStakeAllowance(
  stakeAmount && sodaToken && account.address
    ? { amount, account: account.address as `0x\${string}`, minReceive }
    : undefined,
  spokeProvider,
);

await stake({ amount, account, minReceive, action: 'stake' });   // throws on !ok
```

**After (v2):**

```tsx
const walletProvider = useWalletProvider(selectedChainId);
const srcAddress = account?.address as `0x\${string}` | undefined;

const { mutateAsync: stake } = useStake();
const { mutateAsync: approveStake } = useStakeApprove();
const { data: isStakeAllowed } = useStakeAllowance({
  params: stakeAmount && sodaToken && srcAddress
    ? { srcChainKey: selectedChainId, srcAddress, amount, minReceive }
    : undefined,
});

const result = await stake({
  params: { srcChainKey: selectedChainId, srcAddress, amount, minReceive, action: 'stake' },
  walletProvider,
});
if (!result.ok) { setError(...); return; }
const [spokeTxHash, hubTxHash] = result.value;
```

The five meaningful diffs:

1. `useSpokeProvider(...)` line is gone; `useWalletProvider(...)` value flows directly.
2. Hooks are zero-arg; previous hook-time `spokeProvider` arg is dropped.
3. `account: 0x…` → `srcChainKey + srcAddress`. Allowance hook props become `{ params }`.
4. Mutation result is `Result<[SpokeTxHash, HubTxHash]>` — branch on `result.ok`; do not throw.
5. Approve / allowance hook vars omit the `action` field (hook injects it).

## Per-file Migration Checklist (apps/demo)

These are the actual edits that landed during the migration, not the planned ones:

- **`App.tsx`** — added `StakingPage` import and a `/staking` route after the dex route.
- **`components/shared/header.tsx`** — uncommented the `/staking` nav link entry.
- **`pages/staking/page.tsx`** — biggest file (~600 lines):
  - Dropped `useSpokeProvider`. `walletProvider = useWalletProvider(selectedChainId)` flows
    directly to mutation vars.
  - Extracted `srcAddress = account?.address as \\`0x\\\${string}\\` | undefined` once at
    component scope; reused in every params object.
  - Replaced `spokeChainConfig[selectedChainId]?.supportedTokens.SODA` lookup with
    `sodax.config.findSupportedTokenBySymbol(selectedChainId, 'SODA')` (cleaner v2 SDK API,
    and — critically — picks up any constructor-time `Sodax({ ... })` overrides plus dynamic
    backend config; the direct `spokeChainConfig` import is a packaged-default snapshot that
    silently ignores both).
  - Removed all `as unknown as Record<...>` casts on the SODA token.
  - Mutation calls — drop the `spokeProvider` hook-time arg; pass `{ params, walletProvider }`
    to `mutateAsync`. Build `params` with `srcChainKey: selectedChainId` + `srcAddress`.
    Branch on `result.ok` for every mutation.
  - Allowance hook calls — `useStakeAllowance({ params: { srcChainKey, srcAddress, amount,
    minReceive } })` (no `spokeProvider`, no `action` field). Same for unstake / instant.
  - Approve hook calls — same shape, vars are `{ params: <without action>, walletProvider }`.
  - Removed all top-level `console.log` debug noise that the v1 version had sprinkled in.
- **`components/staking/StakingConfiguration.tsx`** — uncommented as-is. No SDK call shape
  change (`useStakingConfig()` is hub-only no-args).
- **`components/staking/SodaBalance.tsx`** — dropped `spokeProvider` prop. `useSodaBalance`
  signature shrunk to `(chainKey, userAddress)`.
- **`components/staking/StakingInfo.tsx`** — props rename: `{ spokeProvider }` →
  `{ srcAddress, srcChainKey }`. Hook call: `useStakingInfo({ srcAddress, srcChainKey })`.
- **`components/staking/UnstakingInfo.tsx`** — props rename: `{ spokeProvider, userAddress }`
  → `{ srcChainKey, srcAddress, walletProvider }`. Mutation calls (`useClaim` /
  `useCancelUnstake`) build `params` with full `{ srcChainKey, srcAddress, action: 'claim' |
  'cancelUnstake', requestId, amount? }`.
- **`hooks/useSodaBalance.ts`** — rewritten as a thin wrapper around `useXBalances` from
  `@sodax/dapp-kit`. Drops `spokeProvider` arg; takes `(chainKey, userAddress)` only.
  Looks up the SODA token via `sodax.config.findSupportedTokenBySymbol`.

## New Patterns Worth Knowing

### Pattern: `raw: true` for read-only allowance queries

Same trick as dex. `staking.isAllowanceValid<K, Raw>(_params: StakingParamsUnion<K, Raw>)`
intersects with `WalletProviderSlot<K, Raw>`, which forces consumers to either pass a wallet
provider (`raw: false`) or assert raw mode (`raw: true`). Since the underlying read does
not consult `walletProvider`, the cleanest hook implementation is:

```ts
const result = await sodax.staking.isAllowanceValid({
  params: { ...params, action: 'stake' },
  raw: true,
});
if (!result.ok) throw result.error;  // matches useMMAllowance's "throw on !ok inside queryFn"
return result.value;
```

### Pattern: Action-discriminator routing inside a single SDK method

`staking.approve` and `staking.isAllowanceValid` both take a single
`StakingParamsUnion<K, Raw>` discriminated by `params.action`. Internally the SDK
branches on the action to determine which token to approve (SODA for `'stake'`, xSODA for
`'unstake'` and `'instantUnstake'`). Dapp-kit splits this into 6 thin per-action wrappers
(`useStakeApprove` etc.) for v1 ergonomic parity — each hook injects the literal so
callers don't repeat themselves. `Omit<…Params, 'action'>` on the vars makes the contract
explicit.

### Pattern: Cross-chain mutations always return tx-pairs

Every action (`stake`, `unstake`, `instantUnstake`, `claim`, `cancelUnstake`) returns
`Result<[SpokeTxHash, HubTxHash]>` because the SDK internally calls
`relayTxAndWaitPacket` whenever `srcChainKey !== hubChainKey`. **Always destructure as
`[spokeTxHash, hubTxHash]`.** Even if the user happens to be on the hub chain, the SDK
returns `[hubTxHash, hubTxHash]` for shape consistency.

### Pattern: Query-key invalidation moved into hooks

Every v2 mutation hook invalidates the canonical key set in its own `onSuccess`:

- `['staking', 'info', srcChainKey, srcAddress]` — staking + cancelUnstake mutations
- `['staking', 'unstakingInfo']` / `['staking', 'unstakingInfoWithPenalty']` — unstake /
  claim / cancelUnstake mutations
- `['staking', 'allowance', srcChainKey, '<action>']` — corresponding approve mutation
- `['staking', 'stakeRatio']` / `['staking', 'convertedAssets']` — stake mutation
- `['staking', 'instantUnstakeRatio']` — instant-unstake mutation
- `['xBalances', srcChainKey]` — stake / claim / instant-unstake mutations (spoke-side
  balance changes)

Don't reintroduce per-modal invalidations unless there's a query key the hook doesn't already
handle.

### Pattern: `useSodaBalance` thin wrapper around `useXBalances`

The v1 `useSodaBalance` reached into `EvmSpokeProvider` / `SonicSpokeProvider` instances
via `instanceof` checks and called `spokeProvider.publicClient.readContract`. v2 deletes
the spoke-provider classes; the cleanest replacement is a thin wrapper that delegates to
`useXBalances`:

```ts
export function useSodaBalance(chainKey, userAddress): bigint | undefined {
  const { sodax } = useSodaxContext();
  const sodaToken = sodax.config.findSupportedTokenBySymbol(chainKey, 'SODA');
  const xService = useXService(getXChainType(chainKey));
  const { data: balances } = useXBalances({
    xService,
    xChainId: chainKey,
    xTokens: sodaToken ? [sodaToken] : [],
    address: userAddress,
  });
  return sodaToken ? balances?.[sodaToken.address] : undefined;
}
```

Loses the explicit `isLoading` flag; callers can derive it from `balance === undefined`.

## Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting `raw: true` on the allowance query** — TypeScript error
   `Property 'walletProvider' is missing in type ...`. Cause: `isAllowanceValid` requires
   `WalletProviderSlot<K, Raw>` and `raw: false` would force a wallet provider. Fix:
   `{ params, raw: true }` inside the queryFn.

2. **Using `Result<TxReturnType<K, false>>` for stake/unstake mutations** — would match
   `useMMApprove`'s shape. **Wrong.** Staking is cross-chain — the correct return is
   `Result<[SpokeTxHash, HubTxHash]>`. Only the 3 approve hooks return single-tx-hash.

3. **Reading `spokeProvider.chainConfig.chain.name` for display** — gone in v2. Use
   `baseChainInfo[chainKey]?.name` from `@sodax/types`, or the demo's `chainIdToChainName`
   helper at `apps/demo/src/constants.ts`.

4. **Reintroducing `StakingError<Code>` typed-error generic** — gone. The mutation
   error type is plain `Error`; the CODE lives on `error.message`, the underlying chain
   on `error.cause` (ES2022).

5. **Mutation hooks return `Result<T>`; do not `try/catch` and re-throw.** The v1 pattern
   of `try { await mutateAsync(...); } catch (e) { ... }` only catches `mutationFn`
   exceptions (e.g. missing `walletProvider`). SDK-level failures land in `result.ok ===
   false` — branch on that. The legacy try/catch can stay as defense-in-depth for
   unexpected throws.

6. **`xAccount.address` is `string`, not `Address`.** Cast at the boundary:
   `xAccount.address as \\`0x\\\${string}\\`` — safe because `useXAccount(evmChainKey)` returns
   an EVM-shaped address. Extract once at component scope (`const srcAddress = ...`) and
   reuse — don't repeat the cast 8 times.

7. **Each per-action approve/allowance hook injects `params.action` internally.** Callers
   pass `Omit<…Params, 'action'>`. If you accidentally leave `action: 'stake'` in the
   params object, TypeScript will reject it (the `Omit` removed the field from the vars
   shape).

8. **`useSodaBalance`'s isLoading flag is gone.** v1 returned `{ data, isLoading }`; v2
   returns `bigint | undefined` (loading inferred from `undefined`). Adjust call sites:
   `isLoadingSodaBalance = sodaBalance === undefined`.

9. **`useStakingInfo({ srcAddress, srcChainKey })` calls `getStakingInfoFromSpoke`, not
   `getStakingInfo`.** The latter takes a hub-already address and is not surfaced via
   dapp-kit. The former derives the hub wallet from `srcChainKey` + `srcAddress`
   internally.

10. **Demo's `scaleTokenAmount` already exists at `apps/demo/src/lib/utils.ts` —
    don't reimplement it.** Same for `formatTokenAmount` and `getTimeRemaining`.

11. **The 5 mutation hooks are zero-arg.** Calling `useStake(spokeProvider)` (v1 shape) is
    a TS error. Call `useStake()` and pass `walletProvider` in mutation vars.

12. **`UnstakingInfo` no longer accepts `userAddress` separately.** v1 took both
    `spokeProvider` and `userAddress` props but ignored `userAddress` inside the queryFn.
    v2 takes `{ srcAddress, srcChainKey }` and the hook reads `srcAddress` for real.

## Verification Recipe

When migrating a Staking consumer, follow this order:

1. `pnpm --filter @sodax/dapp-kit build` — must produce ESM + CJS + DTS without errors.
   Failures here usually mean a SDK-side type mismatch (e.g. `StakeAction` shape change),
   not consumer issues.
2. **Phase order is load-bearing**: do all 18 hooks in `packages/dapp-kit/src/hooks/staking/`
   **first**, then re-enable the barrel exports, then build dapp-kit. Demo migration depends
   on all 18 exports being live.
3. `pnpm --filter @sodax/dapp-kit checkTs` after the hooks. Then `pnpm --filter sodax-demo
   checkTs`. Errors at the demo stage are almost always one of: missing `srcChainKey` /
   `srcAddress` in params, leftover `spokeProvider` arg on a hook call, leftover
   `action: 'stake'` field in approve/allowance params, or `xAccount.address` casting
   issues.
4. `pnpm --filter sodax-demo lint && pnpm --filter sodax-demo build` once `checkTs` is clean.
5. **Manual smoke test in dev** (`pnpm dev:demo`):
   - `/solver`, `/money-market`, `/bridge`, `/dex` regression checks — all should still work.
   - Connect an EVM wallet on a chain that has SODA configured.
   - `/staking` route renders the page; chain selector + setup visible.
   - Round-trip: enter stake amount → check `useStakeAllowance` → approve → stake → confirm
     `useStakingInfo` updates with new xSODA balance.
   - Unstake flow: enter unstake amount → approve → unstake → confirm
     `useUnstakingInfoWithPenalty` shows the new request → wait or instant-unstake → claim
     or cancel.
   - Watch `useStakeRatio` / `useInstantUnstakeRatio` / `useConvertedAssets` populate live
     as amount inputs change.
   - Check the network/console for any `Result<T>` `!ok` errors.

## Out-of-scope

This migration intentionally did not touch:

- **Other demo features** — the only commented-out demo feature now is `/migrate` (and the
  `partner-fee-claim` / `recovery` legacy pages). Their underlying `@sodax/dapp-kit` hook
  directories also remain commented in `packages/dapp-kit/src/hooks/index.ts`.
- **`apps/web`** — separate, much wider migration. Many `useSpokeProvider` call sites and
  `xChainId` field reads still live there, plus the partner / migrate / pool / save pages
  have their own SDK-shape updates pending.
- **Raw-tx variants** (`createStakeIntent`, `createUnstakeIntent`, etc.) — only worth wiring
  when product needs sign-elsewhere flows.
- **Refactoring the demo's `StakingPage` cognitive complexity** — the file inherits a
  640-line single-component layout from v1 with nested ternaries and a single `useStake`
  page-level state machine. A future cleanup pass could extract sub-forms (StakeForm,
  UnstakeForm, InstantUnstakeForm), but that's out of scope for this migration.
- **Consolidating the 6 per-action approve/allowance hooks into 2 unified hooks** — was
  considered but rejected; v1 API names preserved per project decision.

# Email login with Privy (`wallet-sdk-react` granular skill)

Granular skill for the `privy` field on the `EVM` slot of `SodaxWalletConfig`. Source-of-truth reference lives in the parent broad skill's knowledge tree; this file is the focused workflow only.

## Step 1 — Clarify with user before coding

You write the code; the user owns the Privy app and receives the email code. Ask:

1. **Do they have a Privy App ID?** If not, give them the dashboard checklist in step 0 of the recipe (Email login, Ethereum embedded wallets, allowed origins, test accounts).
2. **Do they accept the trade-offs?** Privy custodies access (no signing while it is down), addresses belong to their Privy app, a lost email is a lost wallet, and the app is billed per signature.
3. **`showWalletUIs` and `disconnectBehavior`?** Both change the UX; the recipe's step 0 explains each choice.
4. **Does the app already mount a `PrivyProvider`?** Then follow the recipe's *App already on Privy?* branch.

## Integration workflow (new v2 code)

1. [`../integration/knowledge/ai-rules.md`](../integration/knowledge/ai-rules.md) — DO / DON'T (read first).
2. [`../integration/knowledge/recipes/setup.md`](../integration/knowledge/recipes/setup.md) — prerequisite: provider mounted with the `EVM` slot.
3. [`../integration/knowledge/recipes/privy-email-login.md`](../integration/knowledge/recipes/privy-email-login.md) — install the peer, add `privy: privy({ appId })`, verify.
4. Lookups → [`../integration/knowledge/reference/api-surface.md`](../integration/knowledge/reference/api-surface.md) (`privy`, `PrivyOptions`, `PRIVY_CONNECTOR_ID`).

### Privy-specific anti-patterns

- **Writing `privy: { appId }` or importing `privy` from the main entry.** The value must come from `privy()` on the `@sodax/wallet-sdk-react/privy` sub-path.
- **Hiding the App ID behind a backend.** It is public; only SODAX API keys need a proxy.
- **Adding `@privy-io/wagmi` or a second `PrivyProvider`.** The SDK mounts Privy itself.
- Full list → the recipe's *Anti-patterns*.

## Migration workflow (port v1 → v2)

None: email login is new in v2. Finish the broad skill's migration first, then add Privy with the integration workflow above.

## Verification

1. `pnpm tsc --noEmit` and the production build pass.
2. `privy: privy({ appId })` sits on the `EVM` slot, imported from `@sodax/wallet-sdk-react/privy`.
3. The user confirms what you cannot test (the email code): "Email (Privy)" appears, a test-account login shows an address that survives a reload, and a small SODAX action signs.

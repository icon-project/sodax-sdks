description: 'Add SODAX multi-chain wallet connectivity to a React dapp with @sodax/wallet-sdk-react — connect/disconnect, account & signing hooks, a headless wallet modal, EVM chain switching, WalletConnect, Privy email login, and bridging the connected wallet into @sodax/sdk. INTEGRATION (write NEW code) — `SodaxWalletProvider` setup and hook-based UX across EVM, Solana, Sui, Bitcoin, Stellar, ICON, Injective, NEAR and Stacks; WalletConnect for non-injected wallets (Fireblocks/Ledger/mobile); `useWalletProvider` for signing SODAX calls. Triggers on "add wallet connect", "set up SodaxWalletProvider", "useXConnect", "useXAccount", "useWalletProvider", "useWalletModal", "wallet modal", "connect button", "multi-chain wallet UI", "WalletConnect for Fireblocks", "email login with Privy". Peer deps: `react >= 19`, `@tanstack/react-query 5.x`. MIGRATION (port v1 → v2) — `useXWagmiStore` left the public API (replace each selector with `useXServices` / `useXService({ xChainType })` / `useXConnections` / `useXConnection({ xChainType })`; do NOT rename to `useXWalletStore`, which is not exported), hooks take single-object params, `SodaxWalletProvider` takes `config: SodaxWalletConfig` (no `rpcConfig` / `options` / `initialState`), and chain slots are top-level on `SodaxWalletConfig` (no `chains: { EVM, … }` wrapper). Triggers on "useXWagmiStore is gone", "SodaxWalletProvider props broke", "old wallet-sdk-react hooks", "upgrade @sodax/wallet-sdk-react". Load this skill if EITHER applies; the body gates by mode.'

# When to use this skill

AGENTS.md routes you here when you're working with `@sodax/wallet-sdk-react` v2 — either writing new code or porting from v1.

**Pick your mode:**

- Writing NEW v2 code (greenfield, no v1 imports)? → § **Integration mode** below.
- Porting EXISTING v1 code to v2 (grep finds `useXWagmiStore`, `rpcConfig`, `initialState`, or positional-args hooks)? → § **Migration mode** below.
- Both? → migration first, then integration.

For backend / non-React → use `sodax-wallet-sdk-core` instead.
For React dapps with hooks wrapping the SDK → also load `sodax-dapp-kit`.

## Prefer a granular skill if the concern is known

If the task is one wallet concern, load its granular skill instead of this broad one. Each links straight to its recipe, for both integration and migration.

| Concern | Granular skill | Trigger phrases |
|---|---|---|
| Connect / disconnect, account and connection state | [`./connect/SKILL.md`](./connect/SKILL.md) | "useXConnect", "useXAccount", "connect button" |
| Headless wallet modal and multi-chain UI | [`./wallet-modal/SKILL.md`](./wallet-modal/SKILL.md) | "useWalletModal", "wallet modal", "connect several chains" |
| Connected wallet → SDK signer | [`./bridge-to-sdk/SKILL.md`](./bridge-to-sdk/SKILL.md) | "useWalletProvider", "pass the wallet to @sodax/sdk" |
| EVM chain switching / wrong network | [`./switch-chain/SKILL.md`](./switch-chain/SKILL.md) | "useEvmSwitchChain", "wrong network banner" |
| Sign an arbitrary message | [`./sign-message/SKILL.md`](./sign-message/SKILL.md) | "useXSignMessage", "prove wallet ownership", "SIWE" |
| WalletConnect / enterprise custody | [`./walletconnect/SKILL.md`](./walletconnect/SKILL.md) | "WalletConnect", "Fireblocks", "Ledger", "mobile-only wallet" |
| Email login (Privy embedded wallet) | [`./privy/SKILL.md`](./privy/SKILL.md) | "add email login", "Privy", "embedded wallet" |

Load this broad skill (keep reading below) for a full wallet setup, several concerns at once, or a v1 port.

## Integration mode (writing new v2 code)

Pick this mode when the consumer is a React dapp that needs SODAX wallet connectivity. Common signals:

- "I need a wallet connect button" — `useXConnect`, `useXAccount`.
- "Multi-chain modal UI" — `useWalletModal`, `useChainGroups`, `useConnectedChains`.
- "Pass the connected wallet to a `@sodax/sdk` swap" — `useWalletProvider({ xChainId })`.
- "Add WalletConnect for enterprise custody (Fireblocks, mobile)" — `walletConnect` field on `SodaxWalletConfig.EVM`.
- "Let users log in with email" / "Privy" — `privy` field on `SodaxWalletConfig.EVM`, built with `privy()` from `@sodax/wallet-sdk-react/privy`.
- "SSR with Next.js" — `ssr: true` flag on the EVM slot.

### Workflow

1. Read [`integration/knowledge/ai-rules.md`](./integration/knowledge/ai-rules.md) — DO / DON'T + workflow.
2. **Always start with setup** → [`integration/knowledge/recipes/setup.md`](./integration/knowledge/recipes/setup.md). Mount `SodaxWalletProvider`, declare chain-type slots, wire `@tanstack/react-query`.
3. Read [`integration/knowledge/architecture.md`](./integration/knowledge/architecture.md) — provider mount tree, frozen config, EVM single-connection model, `xChainType` vs `xChainId`.
4. Task-specific recipes → [`integration/knowledge/recipes/`](./integration/knowledge/recipes/) — `connect-button.md`, `multi-chain-modal.md`, `walletconnect-setup.md`, `privy-email-login.md`, `bridge-to-sdk.md`, `sign-message.md`, `switch-chain.md`, `batch-operations.md`, `chain-detection.md`, `sub-path-imports.md`.
5. Working examples → [`integration/knowledge/examples/`](./integration/knowledge/examples/) — 4 working `.tsx` app shells (`01-minimal-evm`, `02-multi-chain-modal`, `03-nextjs-app-router`, `04-walletconnect-setup`).
6. Lookups → [`integration/knowledge/reference/`](./integration/knowledge/reference/) — hooks, connectors, chain-support, wallet-brands, api-surface.

### Conventions to follow (integration)

- **Single object parameter on every hook.** `useXConnectors({ xChainType: 'EVM' })`, `useXAccount({ xChainId: ChainKeys.BSC_MAINNET })`, `useWalletProvider({ xChainType: 'EVM' })`. `useXAccount` and `useWalletProvider` take **either** `xChainId` (chain key) **or** `xChainType` (family) — never both.
- **`useXConnect` is a React Query mutation.** Pass an `IXConnector` to `mutate` / `mutateAsync`. For provider-managed chains (EVM/Solana/Sui), the resolved value is `undefined` — read the connected account via `useXAccount` after the mutation lands.
- **Persisted connections.** Connections survive page reloads via `localStorage` (key `xwagmi-store`). Gate UI on hydration with `useConnectedChains().status === 'ready'` to avoid flicker.
- **EVM is one connection across all networks.** wagmi covers every configured EVM network under one connector — `useChainGroups` / `useConnectedChains` report a single `EVM` row.
- **Configurable chain opt-in.** `SodaxWalletProvider config` accepts a `SodaxWalletConfig` where top-level keys are `ChainType` slots (`EVM`, `SOLANA`, `SUI`, `BITCOIN`, `STELLAR`, `INJECTIVE`, `ICON`, `NEAR`, `STACKS`). Omit a slot to skip mounting that adapter; pass `{}` to mount with SDK defaults.
- **Don't import concrete chain classes from the barrel.** `EvmXService`, `XverseXConnector`, etc. are **deep-import only** (`@sodax/wallet-sdk-react/xchains/<chain>`). The barrel only exports hooks, types, interfaces, and `SodaxWalletProvider`.

### Wallet modal primitives

Headless building blocks (render-agnostic, wallet-agnostic):

| Hook | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `useWalletModal({ onConnected })` | State machine: `closed → chainSelect → walletSelect → connecting → success \| error`. |
| `useConnectionFlow()` | `connect + status + retry` without a modal. |
| `useBatchConnect({ connectors, skipConnected })` | Sequential connect across every chain a wallet identifier covers. |
| `useBatchDisconnect({ connectors? })` | Mirror of `useBatchConnect`; omit `connectors` to disconnect all. |
| `useChainGroups({ order? })` | One entry per enabled chain; EVM collapses to one group. |
| `useConnectedChains({ order? })` | Aggregate connected view; `status: 'loading' \| 'ready'`. |
| `useIsWalletInstalled({ connectors?, chainType? })` | Cross-chain install check; filters AND. |
| `sortConnectors(xs, { preferred })` | Preferred first, then installed, then original. |

### Top traps to avoid (integration)

1. **Passing both `xChainId` and `xChainType`** to `useXAccount` / `useWalletProvider`. They're mutually exclusive.
2. **Casting the return value of `useWalletProvider`.** Use the chain-key narrowing pattern (passing a specific `xChainId`) to get the typed `IXxxWalletProvider` without `as`.
3. **Importing concrete classes from the barrel.** `EvmXService`, `XverseXConnector`, etc. live behind `@sodax/wallet-sdk-react/xchains/<chain>` deep imports.
4. **Ignoring the persist-hydration gate.** Render UI before `useConnectedChains().status === 'ready'` and you get a flicker / stale-state.
5. **Forgetting WalletConnect setup for enterprise custody.** Default EVM discovery is EIP-6963 (browser extensions only). Fireblocks / Ledger / mobile-only wallets need the `walletConnect` field on the `EVM` slot.

### Verification (integration)

```bash
pnpm tsc --noEmit   # must exit clean
```

Manually verify in browser:
- Connect / disconnect flows work for at least one wallet per enabled chain.
- Page reload preserves the connection (until `useXDisconnect`).
- `useWalletProvider({ xChainId: ChainKeys.X })` returns the chain-narrowed `IXxxWalletProvider`, ready to pass into `@sodax/sdk` calls (with `raw: false`).

## Migration mode (v1 → v2 porting)

Pick this mode if the consumer has v1 wallet-sdk-react patterns. Grep signals:

```bash
grep -rE 'useXWagmiStore|rpcConfig|initialState' src/
grep -rE 'SodaxWalletProvider.*(options|rpcConfig|initialState)' src/
```

The package name **did not change** between v1 and v2 — both versions publish as `@sodax/wallet-sdk-react`. Migration is detected by import surface, not by package name.

If a project has both v1 patterns AND a request for new features: **migration first, then integration**.

### Workflow

1. Read [`migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/ai-rules.md`](./migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/ai-rules.md) — DO / DON'T + workflow + stop conditions.
2. Read [`migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/breaking-changes.md`](./migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/breaking-changes.md) — full narrative of every v1 → v2 change.
3. Apply per-task recipes from [`migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/recipes/`](./migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/recipes/) — `connect-button.md`, `multi-chain-modal.md`, `ssr-setup.md`, `walletconnect-migration.md`.
4. Use [`reference/`](./migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/reference/) lookups when symbols don't match — `imports.md`, `hooks.md`, `config.md`, `components.md`.
5. Verify with [`checklist.md`](./migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/checklist.md).

### Top mechanical changes

1. **`useXWagmiStore` removed from the public API.** v2 does **not** export the store hook at all — neither `useXWagmiStore` nor `useXWalletStore` is available from the package barrel. Replace each `useXWagmiStore(state => state.X)` selector with the matching public hook (`useXServices`, `useXService({ xChainType })`, `useXConnections`, `useXConnection({ xChainType })`, etc.). See [`migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/reference/imports.md`](./migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/reference/imports.md) § "Store hook removed from the public API" for the full field-to-hook map and a STOP decision tree for selectors hitting v2-internal fields. The localStorage persistence key `'xwagmi-store'` is unchanged, so user connections survive the upgrade.
2. **Hook args unified to a single object.** v1 hooks took positional args; v2 hooks take `{ xChainType }` or `{ xChainId }` (mutually exclusive on `useXAccount` / `useWalletProvider`).
3. **`SodaxWalletProvider` props.** v1's `rpcConfig`, `options`, `initialState` props are removed. v2 takes one `config: SodaxWalletConfig` prop where top-level keys are `ChainType` slots (`EVM`, `SOLANA`, `SUI`, …). The old `chains: { EVM, SOLANA, ... }` wrapper is also gone — chain-type slots are now top-level.
4. **Per-chain entry shape varies.** EVM/SOLANA/ICON/NEAR use `{ rpcUrl?, defaults? }`; SUI uses `{ grpcUrl?, defaults? }` (`rpcUrl` is a deprecated alias, and the two are mutually exclusive); BITCOIN/STELLAR/INJECTIVE extend their `*RpcConfig` with `{ defaults? }`; STACKS accepts a preset name or `StacksNetworkLike & { defaults? }`.

### Stop conditions (defer to user)

| Signal | Why stop |
|---|---|
| User wants a chain family not in `integration/knowledge/reference/chain-support.md` | Adding a new chain is a maintainer task. |
| User has a custom `XService` / `XConnector` subclass with non-trivial logic | Custom subclasses are a maintainer-only path. Confirm scope first. |
| User mixes v1 and v2 patterns in new code being written | Do migration first, then integration. |

### DO (migration)

- Replace every `useXWagmiStore(state => state.X)` selector with the matching v2 public hook (`useXServices`, `useXService({ xChainType })`, `useXConnections`, `useXConnection({ xChainType })`, …) — drop the `useXWagmiStore` import entirely. See `migration-v1-to-v2/knowledge/reference/imports.md` § "Store hook removed" for the field-to-hook map.
- Reshape `SodaxWalletProvider` props to the single `config` object.
- Move RPC config from old `rpcConfig` prop to per-chain `{ rpcUrl }` under the relevant slot.
- For EVM-only WalletConnect setup (Fireblocks etc.), add `walletConnect: { projectId: '…' }` to the EVM slot — see `recipes/walletconnect-migration.md`.

### DO NOT (migration)

- **Rename `useXWagmiStore` to `useXWalletStore`.** The v2 barrel does not export either name. The store implementation file is named `useXWalletStore.ts` internally, but the hook is private — every consumer call site must move to a public hook.
- Keep destructuring positional args from hooks — every v2 hook takes one object.
- Use `rpcConfig` / `options` / `initialState` props on `SodaxWalletProvider` — they're gone.
- Pass both `xChainId` and `xChainType` to `useXAccount` / `useWalletProvider` — mutually exclusive.
- Forget about persist hydration. `useConnectedChains().status === 'ready'` gates UI; render too early and you get flicker.

### Verification (migration)

```bash
pnpm tsc --noEmit                                      # must exit clean
grep -rE 'useXWagmiStore|useXWalletStore' src/         # empty — v2 exports neither
grep -rE 'SodaxWalletProvider.*(rpcConfig|initialState)' src/   # empty
```

Manual: connections still survive page reload (localStorage key `xwagmi-store` was preserved for backward compat).

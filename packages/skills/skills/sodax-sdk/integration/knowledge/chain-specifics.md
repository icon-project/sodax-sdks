# Chain specifics — chain quirks

EVM chains mostly work uniformly through `IEvmWalletProvider`, with **one** native-value exception (Hedera, below). Non-EVM chains have more particularities you need to handle. This file documents each chain family's quirks.

## Section index

EVM:

0. [Hedera HBAR msg.value scaling](#0-hedera-hbar-msgvalue-scaling) — `HEDERA_MAINNET`. The only EVM-family quirk: native deposits scale `msg.value` by 10^10. Handled automatically by the SDK.

Non-EVM:

1. [Stellar account activation and trustline](#1-stellar-account-activation-and-trustline) — `STELLAR_MAINNET`. The account must exist on ledger (sponsored creation covers new 0-XLM wallets) and, for non-XLM assets, hold a trustline before it can receive.
2. [Bitcoin PSBT and Bound Exchange](#2-bitcoin-psbt-and-radfi) — `BITCOIN_MAINNET`. PSBT signing; trading wallet; Bound Exchange auth/session.
3. [Solana PDA derivation](#3-solana-pda-derivation) — `SOLANA_MAINNET`. Deterministic addresses; one-time setup utilities.
4. [ICON Hana wallet](#4-icon-hana-wallet) — `ICON_MAINNET`. Low-level Hana-extension helpers; chain key string vs numeric ID.
5. [NEAR connector discovery](#5-near-connector-discovery) — `NEAR_MAINNET`. Account-id semantics; multiple wallet variants.

## 0. Hedera HBAR msg.value scaling

**Quirk:** HBAR is tracked with **8 decimals** in SODAX spoke accounting, but Hedera's EVM layer treats native `msg.value` as **18 decimals**. So for a native-HBAR deposit the on-chain `msg.value` must be the 8-decimal amount multiplied by **10^10**, even though the asset-manager `transfer` argument stays in 8 decimals.

### How v2 handles it

**Nothing to do — it's automatic.** `EvmSpokeService` scales `msg.value` internally when the source chain is `HEDERA_MAINNET` and the deposit is native; every other EVM chain passes the amount through unchanged. You always pass the canonical 8-decimal HBAR amount to the deposit / swap / bridge call, exactly as you would any other chain's native amount — the spoke service applies the 10^10 factor only to the transaction's `value` field.

### Pitfall

Do **not** pre-scale the amount yourself. Pass the plain 8-decimal HBAR amount; multiplying by 10^10 before handing it to the SDK double-scales and overpays. The scaling applies only to the native token (HBAR) — HTS / ERC-20 token deposits on Hedera carry `value: 0` and are unaffected.

## 1. Stellar account activation and trustline

**Requirement:** a Stellar address only becomes an account once it exists on ledger (it must be "activated" by an account-creation transaction — a plain balance check is not a valid substitute). On top of that, before an account can hold or receive a non-XLM asset, it must establish a trustline to the asset issuer. SODAX's bridge / swap / money-market deliver assets to Stellar — the destination account must exist and (for non-XLM assets) have an active trustline, or the operation fails.

### How v2 handles it

Feature services delegate Stellar readiness handling to the Stellar spoke service internally — there is **no** public `checkStellarTrustline` / `requestStellarTrustline` method on `BridgeService`. The unified allowance/approve flow covers both conditions:

- `isAllowanceValid` for a Stellar chain key returns `false` when the account is not on ledger yet **or** the trustline is insufficient.
- `approve` runs **funding first, trustline second**: if the account does not exist, it is created with a zero starting balance through the SDK's sponsored account creation service (the sponsor account pays the base reserves; the user's wallet only signs), and then a trustline is requested unless the token doesn't need one (native XLM and legacy bnUSD are exempt). Sponsored account creation needs a signing wallet provider, so this path is not available with `raw: true`.

For direct interaction outside the standard `approve` flow, reach for the Stellar spoke service:

```ts
import { ChainKeys, type StellarSpokeService } from '@sodax/sdk';

const stellarSpoke = sodax.spoke.getSpokeService(ChainKeys.STELLAR_MAINNET) as StellarSpokeService;
// hasValidStellarAccount / requestSponsoredAccountCreation / hasSufficientTrustline / requestTrustline
```

### When to gate

Before any swap / bridge / money-market operation that **delivers** an asset to a Stellar destination, the destination account must exist on ledger, and for non-XLM assets must already trust the asset. Failed checks surface as `VALIDATION_FAILED` errors; use `error.context.reason` to disambiguate. The standard pattern for app code is to call `sodax.bridge.approve(...)` (or the matching feature's approve) on the Stellar wallet first, which activates the account and establishes the trustline as a side effect.

### Pitfall

A brand-new Stellar wallet (never funded) has **no on-ledger account** — receiving anything fails until it is created. Sponsored creation handles the account itself, but a freshly created account still holds 0 XLM: establishing a trustline afterwards requires the account to cover the trustline reserve and fee, so trustline-requiring assets may still need the account to hold some XLM first. Treat both conditions as one-time setup steps gated by the standard `approve` flow.

## 2. Bitcoin PSBT and Bound Exchange

Bitcoin support uses Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) — a different model than EVM tx signing. The wallet provider (`BTCWalletProvider`) handles PSBT construction and signing internally.

### Address types

```ts
type BtcAddressType = 'P2PKH' | 'P2SH' | 'P2WPKH' | 'P2TR';
```

`BTCWalletProvider` config takes an `addressType`. `'P2WPKH'` (native SegWit) is the modern default; `'P2TR'` (Taproot) is supported but may have lower compatibility with some on-chain logic.

### Bound Exchange (auth + trading wallet)

SODAX uses the Bound Exchange infrastructure for Bitcoin. Each user gets a derived "trading wallet" funded from their main BTC address. Operations consume UTXOs from the trading wallet rather than directly from the user's main address.

The Bound Exchange provider is owned by `BitcoinSpokeService`. Reach it via the spoke router:

```ts
import { ChainKeys, type BitcoinSpokeService } from '@sodax/sdk';

const btcSpoke = sodax.spoke.getSpokeService(ChainKeys.BITCOIN_MAINNET) as BitcoinSpokeService;
const radfi = btcSpoke.radfi;   // RadfiProvider instance
```

Most consumer flows don't need to touch `radfi` directly — `sodax.bridge.bridge(...)`, `sodax.swaps.createIntent(...)`, etc. handle the Bound Exchange auth + trading-wallet routing internally on the Bitcoin path. For explicit lifecycle management:

```ts
// Authenticate against Bound Exchange (the wallet signs an auth message):
await radfi.authenticateWithWallet(/* args per RadfiProvider source */);

// Fetch the trading wallet for an address (creating it if needed):
const tradingWallet = await radfi.getTradingWallet(personalAddress);

// Read the trading wallet's BTC + token balances:
const balance = await radfi.getBalance(tradingWallet.address);

// Check whether a trading wallet exists without provisioning one:
const exists = await radfi.checkIfTradingWalletExists(personalAddress);
```

**Server-side / raw flows (no interactive sign-in).** A backend that builds raw Bitcoin intents can't run the BIP322 login, so seed a pre-provisioned Bound token instead of authenticating. `RadfiProvider` honors three injection points: `new Sodax({ ... })` with `radfi.accessToken` (and optional `refreshToken`) in the Bitcoin chain config (the constructor seeds them), `radfi.setRadfiAccessToken(token)` at runtime, or a per-action `extras.bound.accessToken` on `createIntent` (the Bitcoin-gated `bound` slot groups Bound/Radfi inputs). If an authenticated Bound call has neither a token nor a configured `apiKey`, `RadfiProvider` throws a legible `RadfiApiError` (the message names the fix: inject via `setRadfiAccessToken` or `new Sodax({ ... })` with `radfi.accessToken`) instead of sending an empty bearer and getting an opaque 403.

Other public methods on `RadfiProvider` you may need: `setRadfiAccessToken`, `refreshAccessToken`, `createTradingWallet`, `createWithdrawTransaction`, `requestRadfiSignature`, `getExpiredUtxos`, `buildRenewUtxoTransaction`, `signAndBroadcastRenewUtxo`, `withdrawToUser`, `signAndBroadcastWithdraw`, `getMaxWithdrawable`. Read `RadfiProvider` source for argument shapes — the API surface is broader than typical chain providers.

### Pitfall

`BitcoinSpokeService.radfi` is what feature services use under the hood. Bypassing the feature services and driving Bound Exchange yourself works but is rarely needed — and you have to wire token balances + UTXO state manually. Prefer the standard feature flows unless you specifically need lifecycle control.

## 3. Solana PDA derivation

Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) are deterministic Solana addresses derived from a program ID + seeds. SODAX uses PDAs for the user's spoke-side state on Solana.

The SDK derives PDAs internally — consumers don't usually need to do this manually. For advanced use cases (preflight, off-chain state lookups), reach into the Solana spoke service via the router:

```ts
import { ChainKeys, type SolanaSpokeService } from '@sodax/sdk';

const solanaSpoke = sodax.spoke.getSpokeService(ChainKeys.SOLANA_MAINNET) as SolanaSpokeService;
// Use the spoke service's typed methods for any PDA-related read or write.
```

### `SolanaSpokeService` specifics

- Solana txs are different shape from EVM (multiple instructions per tx; signed once globally).
- `TxReturnType<typeof ChainKeys.SOLANA_MAINNET, false>` is the base58-encoded signature string (not `0x…`).
- `SolanaRawTransaction` is the raw-tx return for `raw: true` — base64-encoded message for downstream signing.

### Pitfall

Solana addresses are base58 PublicKey strings, not `0x…` hex. `GetAddressType<typeof ChainKeys.SOLANA_MAINNET>` resolves to a base58-typed string brand; passing a hex address is a TypeScript error.

## 4. ICON Hana wallet

ICON uses the Hana browser-extension wallet for dApp signing. The SDK ships low-level helper functions (file: `HanaWalletConnector.ts`) that wrap the Hana extension's JSON-RPC interface; consumers compose them into an `IIconWalletProvider` implementation.

```ts
import { requestAddress, requestSigning, requestJsonRpc } from '@sodax/sdk';

const result = await requestAddress();   // returns Result<IconAddress>
if (result.ok) {
  const address = result.value;          // 'hx…'
}
```

ICON spoke calls require an `IIconWalletProvider`. Implementations either compose the helper functions above into a class your app owns, or use the reference implementation that ships in `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core` (separate package, install separately).

### `ChainKeys.ICON_MAINNET` is a string `'0x1.icon'`

The ICON chain key is the **string** `'0x1.icon'`, not the legacy numeric chain id `0x1`. This trips up code that did `Number(chainId)` to coerce — that returns `NaN` for `'0x1.icon'`.

```ts
ChainKeys.ICON_MAINNET === '0x1.icon';            // true
Number(ChainKeys.ICON_MAINNET);                   // NaN
chainKey === ChainKeys.ICON_MAINNET;              // works
```

### Address types

- `hx…` — externally-owned account (user wallet).
- `cx…` — contract account.

`GetAddressType<typeof ChainKeys.ICON_MAINNET>` accepts both via a string brand.

### Injective (similar pattern)

Injective is a separate chain family but uses a similar wallet-extension model. Wallet helper: `Injective20Token` (in `@sodax/sdk`'s injective utilities). `IInjectiveWalletProvider` implementations can use Keplr, Leap, or other Cosmos-ecosystem wallets.

## 5. NEAR connector discovery

NEAR has multiple wallet variants (NEAR Wallet, MyNearWallet, Meteor, Sender, …). NEAR spoke calls require an `INearWalletProvider`. The interface is exported from `@sodax/sdk`; consumers supply an object satisfying it. A reference implementation ships in `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core` (separate package — install separately); browser-side connector discovery for the multiple NEAR wallet variants happens there, not in `@sodax/sdk` itself.

### Account ID semantics

NEAR addresses come in two forms:

- **Named accounts** — `alice.near`, `mybiz.near`. Human-readable.
- **Implicit accounts** — 64-character hex strings.

Both are valid. `GetAddressType<typeof ChainKeys.NEAR_MAINNET>` accepts both via a string type.

### Pitfall

`NearWalletProvider` requires the `accountId` field at construction (alongside `privateKey`). Unlike EVM, NEAR can't derive an account from a key alone — keys are scoped to accounts.

### Receiving tokens: NEP-141 storage registration

Before a NEAR account can **receive** (hold a balance of) a NEP-141 token, it must pay a one-time storage bond on that token contract — delivering to an unregistered account fails. This gates any flow that delivers a token to a user on NEAR: swap output on NEAR, bridge into NEAR, money-market borrow/withdraw to NEAR. (Native NEAR is not a NEP-141 token and needs no registration.)

The NEAR spoke service exposes two methods — reach it via `sodax.spoke.near` or `sodax.spoke.getSpokeService(ChainKeys.NEAR_MAINNET)`:

- `isStorageRegistered(token, accountId): Promise<boolean>` — whether `accountId` can already receive `token`. Returns `true` for the native token (no NEP-141). Read-only; uses the configured NEAR RPC.
- `registerStorage({ token, accountId, walletProvider, deposit?, raw? })` — submits a `storage_deposit` for `accountId`; returns the tx hash (or the unsigned tx when `raw: true`). `deposit` defaults to `NEAR_STORAGE_DEPOSIT` (0.00125 NEAR, exported from `@sodax/sdk`) — override per token if its `storage_balance_bounds.min` differs. Throws for the native token. The recipient's NEAR wallet signs it.

Gate pattern, run before delivering to NEAR:

```ts
// @ai-snippets-skip — illustrative.
const near = sodax.spoke.near;
if (!(await near.isStorageRegistered(token, accountId))) {
  await near.registerStorage({ token, accountId, walletProvider });
}
```

The `sodax-dapp-kit` skill wraps these as the `useNearStorageCheck` / `useRegisterNearStorage` hooks plus a `resolveNearStorageGate` helper (integration mode).

### `ft_transfer_call` attaches 1 yoctoNEAR

Deposits **from** NEAR (`deposit()` / `fillIntent()` on the NEAR spoke service) call the token's `ft_transfer_call`, which per NEP-141 must carry **exactly 1 yoctoNEAR** — the spoke service attaches it automatically. The signer only needs a small NEAR balance to cover gas (the 1 yoctoNEAR is dust). Native-token deposits use a plain `transfer` and aren't subject to this.

## Other non-EVM chains

| Chain | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Sui** (`SUI_MAINNET`) | Address: 32-byte `0x…` (different from EVM addresses despite the prefix). Wallet provider `ISuiWalletProvider` uses `@mysten/sui` under the hood. |
| **Stacks** (`STACKS_MAINNET`) | Address: `SP…` (mainnet) / `ST…` (testnet). Uses `@stacks/transactions` for tx construction. |
| **Injective** (`INJECTIVE_MAINNET`) | Cosmos-ecosystem chain. Address: `inj1…`. Wallet provider uses `@injectivelabs/sdk-ts`. |

Each has its own `I*WalletProvider` interface with chain-specific signing methods. The `chainType` discriminant on every `I*WalletProvider` instance lets you narrow at runtime without `instanceof`.

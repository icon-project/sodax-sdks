 * Abstract base class for blockchain service implementations.

 * The XService class serves as a foundation for implementing blockchain-specific services
 * in a multi-chain environment. It provides a standardized interface for:
 * 1. Managing wallet connectors for different blockchain types
 * 2. Querying token balances across different chains
 *
 * Each blockchain implementation (e.g., Solana, EVM chains) extends this class
 * to provide chain-specific functionality while maintaining a consistent interface.

 * @class XService
 * @property {ChainType} xChainType - The blockchain type this service handles (e.g., 'SOLANA', 'EVM')
 * @property {XConnector[]} xConnectors - Available wallet connectors for this chain

 * Returns the connected `XAccount` for a chain family.

 * Pass either `xChainId` (a `SpokeChainKey` — auto-resolved to its family) or
 * `xChainType` (a `ChainType` directly), never both. EVM is family-level — wagmi
 * maintains a single connection across every configured EVM network.
 *
 * Always returns a populated object, never `undefined`. When no wallet is connected,
 * `address` is `undefined` but `xChainType` is filled — consumers can render
 * `account.address ?? <ConnectCta />` without null-checking the wrapper.

Add Tron as a spoke chain (`ChainKeys.TRON_MAINNET`, chain type `'TRON'`).

Tron settles through the **MPC relay** rather than the intent relay: a deposit is a transfer to the shared reserve carrying a 32-byte payload-hash memo spliced into the raw transaction, and a withdrawal is authorized with scheme 1 — a TIP-191-wrapped signature the contract recovers the signer from. The reserve address comes from the relay per call rather than being fixed, so a client must pay the address from the current response.

New public surface:

- `@sodax/types` — `TronChainKey`, `TronSpokeChainConfig`, `TronRawTransaction`, `TronReturnType`, `TronRawTransactionReceipt`, `TronGasEstimate`, `TronUnsignedTransaction` and the `ITronWalletProvider` interface, plus the `tron` entries in `spokeChainConfig` and `supportedTokensByChain` (native TRX and USDT), and the `MpcRelayChainMap` / `MpcRelayChainKey` registry with `isMpcRelayChainKey` and `getMpcRelayChainInfo`.
- `@sodax/sdk` — `sodax.spoke.tron` (`TronSpokeService`), `MpcRelayApiService` for the relay REST flow, and `SpokeService.settle()`: one settlement seam that feature services call after `create*Intent`, routing MPC-relay chains to their relay service and everything else to the intent relay. Existing chains keep the same verify-then-relay behavior and the same `SodaxError` codes.
- `@sodax/wallet-sdk-core` — `TronWalletProvider` in both raw-key and TronLink modes.
- `@sodax/wallet-sdk-react` — `TronXService` and `TronXConnector`, wired into `chainRegistry` and `SodaxWalletConfig`.

Tron is money-market listed (TRX and USDT), and both are swap-supported in the **staging** solver environment only — read the full staging set with `getStagingSolverTokens`. Bridge, partner-fee and recovery include Tron automatically.

Also wires Tron into `GetTxReceiptType`, so `waitForTransactionReceipt` on `tron` resolves to `TronRawTransactionReceipt` instead of `unknown`.

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository. Each package under `packages/` has its own `CLAUDE.md` with package-specific guidance — read the relevant one before working in that package.

## Project Overview

SODAX is a cross-chain DeFi platform built on a **hub-and-spoke architecture** where **Sonic is the hub chain**. It supports swaps (intent-based via solver), lending/borrowing (money market), staking, bridging, DEX (concentrated liquidity), token migration, and partner fee operations across 20 blockchains:

- **EVM (12):** Sonic (hub), Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, BSC, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, HyperEVM, Lightlink, Redbelly, Kaia
- **Non-EVM (8):** Solana, Sui, Stellar, ICON, Injective, NEAR, Stacks, Bitcoin

## Monorepo Structure

Turborepo + pnpm workspace. Package manager: **pnpm 10.32.1**.

### Apps

- `apps/demo` — Vite + React demo app for SDK showcase
- `apps/node` — Node.js scripts for E2E testing various chain operations
- `apps/node-cjs` — Node.js regression test for CJS
- `apps/wallet-modal-example` — Vite + React demo app for Wallet React SDK showcase


### Packages

- `packages/sdk` — **Core SDK.** Hub-and-spoke service architecture. Modules: `swap`, `bridge`, `moneyMarket`, `staking`, `migration`, `partner`, `dex`, `backendApi`. Entry point: `Sodax` class. See `packages/sdk/CLAUDE.md`.
- `packages/types` — Shared TypeScript type definitions: chain IDs, chain configs, wallet provider interfaces, backend API types, constants for all 20 chains. See `packages/types/CLAUDE.md`.
- `packages/wallet-sdk-core` — Low-level multi-chain wallet providers (signing, broadcasting) for 9 chain types. Dual config: private-key (scripts/testing) and browser-extension (production). See `packages/wallet-sdk-core/CLAUDE.md`.
- `packages/wallet-sdk-react` — React layer over wallet-sdk-core. Abstract `XService`/`XConnector` pattern, Zustand state persistence, EIP-6963 wallet discovery. See `packages/wallet-sdk-react/CLAUDE.md`.
- `packages/dapp-kit` — High-level React hooks (100+) combining SDK + wallet-sdk-react + React Query. Organized by feature domain. See `packages/dapp-kit/CLAUDE.md`.

### Package dependency chain

- sdk (`@sodax/sdk`) depends on types package (`@sodax/types`), it both imports and exports it.
- dapp-kit (`@sodax/dapp-kit`) depends on sdk (`@sodax/sdk`), it both imports and exports it.
- types (`@sodax/types`) has no package dependencies.
- wallet-sdk-core (`@sodax/wallet-sdk-core`) depends on types package (`@sodax/types`), it only imports it.
- wallet-sdk-react (`@sodax/wallet-sdk-react`) depends on (`@sodax/types`) and wallet-sdk-core (`@sodax/wallet-sdk-core`), it only imports them.

## Common Commands

```bash
pnpm i                    # Install dependencies
pnpm dev:demo             # Run demo app dev server
pnpm build                # Build everything (packages must build before apps)
pnpm build:packages       # Build only SDK packages
pnpm lint                 # Lint with Biome (auto-fixes)
pnpm pretty               # Format with Biome (auto-fixes)
pnpm checkTs              # TypeScript type checking across all packages
pnpm test                 # Run tests across all packages
pnpm clean                # Remove all node_modules, dist, .turbo, .next
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **Only change code directly related to the task at hand.** Do not refactor, restyle, rename, or "improve" surrounding code that is not part of the requested changes. Unrelated modifications risk breaking existing behavior (e.g., removing hover effects, animations, or styles that were intentionally designed). If you notice something that could be improved but is outside the scope of the request, mention it to the user instead of changing it.
- **Never use `bigint` in types that will be passed to `JSON.stringify`** — it throws `TypeError` at runtime. Use `string` for numeric fields in API request/response types. If `bigint` is needed in domain types, convert to string before serialization.
- **Always use standard Tailwind utility classes instead of arbitrary pixel values** when an equivalent exists. Examples: `text-sm` not `text-[14px]`, `text-base` not `text-[16px]`, `h-4` not `h-[16px]`, `size-4` not `size-[16px]`. Only use arbitrary values (e.g. `min-w-[204px]`, `leading-[1.4]`) when no standard utility matches. Font families use arbitrary values (`font-[InterRegular]`, `font-[InterBold]`) — this is the project convention since fonts are registered as CSS custom properties in `globals.css`.
- **Never instantiate SDK clients (Resend, etc.) at module level in API routes** — env vars aren't available during Next.js build-time static page collection. Always create instances inside the handler or a called function.
- **Environment variables used only at runtime** (API keys, secrets) must NOT be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Only prefix env vars that need to be exposed to the browser.
- **API routes must handle errors gracefully** — always return a JSON response with an appropriate status code, never let exceptions bubble up as 500 with no body.
- **Webhook endpoints must always return 200** — external services (Resend, etc.) retry on non-2xx responses. A misconfigured secret or bad payload should be logged, not cause an infinite retry storm.
- **Build order matters** — packages must build before apps. Use `pnpm build:packages` first, or `pnpm build` which handles ordering via Turborepo.
- **All SDK packages produce dual ESM/CJS output** via tsup. Use `.js` extensions in relative imports within source (tsup resolves them).


### Running tests for a specific package

```bash
cd packages/<pkg> && pnpm test          # Unit tests (excludes e2e)
cd packages/<pkg> && pnpm test-e2e      # E2E tests only
cd packages/<pkg> && pnpm coverage      # Coverage report
```

To run a single test file with Vitest:
```bash
cd packages/<pkg> && npx vitest run path/to/test.test.ts
```

## Code Style & Linting

**Biome** is the sole linter/formatter (no ESLint/Prettier). Config is in root `biome.json`.

Key rules enforced:
- No `any` types (`noExplicitAny: error`, `noImplicitAnyLet: error`)
- No non-null assertions (`noNonNullAssertion: error`)
- Use template literals over string concatenation (`useTemplate: error`)
- Use `import type` for type-only imports (`useImportType: warn`)
- Use `node:` prefix for Node.js builtins (`useNodejsImportProtocol: error`)
- No inferrable types (`noInferrableTypes: error`)
- **No `as unknown as <Type>` double-casts in non-test source files.** This pattern strips the type system entirely and hides real issues (bad generic inference, wrong param shapes, unmodeled union). If you feel the need for one, stop and fix the underlying type — add a proper generic/conditional, a narrowing guard, or an overload. Allowed only inside `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` where mocks intentionally defeat types.

Formatting: 2-space indent, 120 char line width, single quotes, semicolons required, trailing commas, LF line endings.

**Important:** Some packages have local `biome.json` overrides that relax root rules (e.g., `wallet-sdk-core` disables `noNonNullAssertion` and `noExplicitAny`). These are **tech debt** — always flag them and suggest fixing the underlying code rather than relying on the override.

Pre-commit hooks (via Husky + lint-staged) auto-format and lint staged files. Commits must follow **conventional commits** format (enforced by commitlint).

### Naming & Clean Code

Write code that reads like well-written prose. Every name should tell the reader **what** it holds and **why** it exists — without needing a comment or surrounding context to understand it.

**Names must reveal intent — no single-letter or vague variables:**
- `const normalizedSymbol = symbol.toLowerCase()` not `const s = symbol.toLowerCase()`
- `const openDelayId = setTimeout(...)` not `const t = setTimeout(...)`
- `const referenceRect = reference.getBoundingClientRect()` not `const r = reference.getBoundingClientRect()`
- `const priceAtCursor = yScale.invert(...)` not `const p = yScale.invert(...)`
- `leadMagnetResponse` / `newsArticles` not `res` / `data` for fetch results — name what the data *is*, not that it's data

**No magic values — extract to named constants:**
- `const FEEDBACK_CLEAR_DELAY_MS = 3000` not a bare `3000` in `setTimeout`
- `const PRICE_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS = 30_000` not `setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 30000)`
- `const ONE_HOUR_MS = 60 * 60 * 1000` not inline `60 * 60 * 1000` in time calculations

**One word, one concept — be consistent across the codebase:**
- Data-fetching functions in `lib/`: prefix with `get` (`getAssetUsdPrice`, `getNewsArticles`)
- React Query hook wrappers in `hooks/`: prefix with `use` (`useStakeVaultApy`, `useDexPositions`)
- Event handlers in components: prefix with `handle` (`handleSubmit`, `handleConnect`)
- Don't mix `fetch`/`get`/`retrieve`/`load` for the same pattern

**Types = nouns, functions = verbs, hooks = `use` prefix:**
- Types/interfaces: `SwapRoute`, `LendingPosition`, `StakeVaultApy`
- Functions: `calculateFee`, `submitTransaction`, `normalizeSymbol`
- Hooks: `useChainBalances`, `useTokenPrice`

**Self-documenting over comments.** If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, rename the function. Add JSDoc only for non-obvious behavior: side effects, error semantics, expected units/formats. Never let comments drift from code (e.g., `// 10 second timeout` on a 30-second timeout).

## Architecture Notes

### Hub-and-Spoke Model

All cross-chain operations route through the **hub chain (Sonic)**. The SDK models this via:
- `EvmHubProvider` — interacts with hub contracts (vault tokens, asset manager, wallet abstraction)
- Per-chain `SpokeProvider` implementations — handle chain-specific contract calls, then relay to/from hub
- `IntentRelayApiService` — relays intents between hub and spoke chains

### SDK Package Overview

| Package | Role | Build | Key Abstractions |
|---------|------|-------|-----------------|
| `sdk` | Core business logic | tsup (ESM+CJS) | `Sodax` facade, `*Service` classes, `*SpokeProvider`, `EvmHubProvider` |
| `types` | Shared type definitions | tsc | Chain configs, wallet provider interfaces, backend API types |
| `wallet-sdk-core` | Wallet signing/broadcasting | tsup (ESM+CJS) | `*WalletProvider` per chain (private-key + browser-extension configs) |
| `wallet-sdk-react` | React wallet state | tsup (ESM+CJS) | `XService`/`XConnector` abstractions, Zustand store, `SodaxWalletProvider` |
| `dapp-kit` | React hooks for dApps | tsup (ESM+CJS) | `SodaxProvider`, 100+ feature-organized hooks via React Query |

## CI Pipeline

GitHub Actions runs on push to `main`/`development` and all PRs:
1. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
2. `pnpm lint`
3. `pnpm build:packages`
4. `pnpm checkTs`
5. `pnpm build`

Tested against Node.js 20.x, 22.x, 24.x.
